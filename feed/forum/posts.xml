						 <p>even if it's supposed to set up a series where the subject matter is more serious, I think this piece is just&#8230; <em>executed</em> and <em>conceived</em> in a way where I can't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> read comedy. I have the written examples above, which I feel like come off as attempts to execute humor whenever they or lines like them pop up in this piece&#8230; but also, like, the <em>plot itself</em> is a bit funny. you can't tell me that:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;I am Dante. I am a Wizard, sole survivor of the Last Coven. And <strong>I am here to save you.</strong>&quot;</p> <p>That's when I collapsed, falling face-first to the floor, <strong>covered in shit.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>isn't supposed to be dramatic irony for the sake of comedy. as aforementioned, the magic bag being a sentient little monster thing that won't spit out items until it gets fucking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beef jerky</span> is also <em>clearly</em> supposed to be funny.</p> <p>it works, mind you, but if you intend your series to be more suited to drama, the voice that's in this piece simply won't cut it.</p> <p>for what it's worth, you can ping me in the Backrooms Discord if you ever post a draft for your article publicly; i'll try to make time to look at it and give it a line-by-line critique to help you out</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17444272/the-lone-sorcerer">The Lone Sorcerer</a>

						 <p>This is a really great and concise analysis! I'll keep what you've said here in mind, but I fear without having you specifically look at future articles, this will happen again. You were right in that the way I put this together (in like, 3 hours) was supposed to produce a very specific style of voice, and I feel that &quot;vocal duds&quot; like this are going to happen. To a certain degree, it sells his character better; Dante is no writer himself. But I understand that's kind of just an excuse to be a little redundant/dull occasionally.</p> <p>One thing I didn't quite jive with is the implication that this was a comedy? I mean, it has maybe a tone of it, but it's intended to be a setup for a serious series. Maybe I accidentally implied it, somehow? let me know.</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17444272/the-lone-sorcerer">The Lone Sorcerer</a>

						 <p>this is absolutely excellent.</p> <p>first off, I have to compliment the profound artistic choice to make this a script; something which, against the backdrop of dramatic images and the sparse, lonesome liminal spaces of 0 and this Other Place which our characters begin in, servers only to elevate the contents of the article by giving an immediate <em>awareness</em> to the reader of why this thing is written the way it is. furthermore, I found the cut-offs and formatting themselves of the div blocks quite tastefully done &#8212; it reminds me almost of the opening pages of <span style="color: blue">House</span> of Leaves, for some reason, even though the only thing it reasonably shares is the Garamond font and the slightly weathered, yellowed page &#8212; and a great way to hide the trail-offs of the poem. even these trail-offs, in my eyes, are quite good details: I really enjoy the foreshadowing to Malinda's abortion here, and I think that this detail turns what otherwise could be interpreted as a tasteless emotional interlude which is done to advance narrative rather than character into an exciting realization of the folklorish aspects of this tale. it invites the reader to consider the choice to obscure the thematic elements of this tale behind Irish, and I think that's beautiful.</p> <p>now onto the writing itself, which I think is equally well-done. it is simultaneously well-grounded, with such lines as:</p> <blockquote> <p>EOGHAN shivers and decides it's probably worth it to sit. He gives one last worried glance to the heater before settling into its warmth.</p> </blockquote> <p>coming off genuinely stirring and engaging, excellent examples of how to show the emotional world of a character in the objective third person, being contrasted against the actual content of the tale, which is dreamlike, surreal, <em>poetic</em>.</p> <p>the pacing here is incredibly well-done, not just because it's short but because this thing grabs you and refuses to let go, each line load-bearing in the grand metaphor that is this play. the pattern that it appears you used here &#8212; character line, setting description, action line &#8212; is used to wonderful extent here to hook in the reader. the artistic interlude, wherein the theme of this play is <em>literally</em> screamed at the reader, comes at just the right moment to justify continued reading.</p> <p>and then the FIGHT OH MY GOD THE FIGHT it in <em>all</em> reason should not be as climactic as it is in here: we have the big and <em>by this point obvious</em> reveal that Malinda isn't right, the in-universe loredump as to what the <em>FUCK</em> a banshee is (I didn't know, at least) and <em>then</em>, by some narrative sleight of hand, what <em>should</em> be cliche and expected &#8212; the room where Malinda's past companions were is barricaded and they're going to die with her lifeless body strewn there &#8212; is made genuinely compelling. you <em>care</em> about KRAM says, even though there is absolutely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">zero</span> character exposition here; it speaks to a universal guilt &#8212; which, as I write it, also has implications on the metatextual element of this tale &#8212; which the page boldly assumes the reader has (don't worry, God knows I have it in spades). the fight itself is tense and energetic, and the reveal that EOGHAN accidentally makes KRAM noclip into 0, where he will go insane inside the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">true hell</span> that 0 is&#8230; <em>is chilling.</em></p> <p>an absolutely phenomenal page overall, on both the technical and content sides&#8230; <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/selenophilia" target="_blank">it might even be better than my own entry into Folklorecon!</a></p> <p>i'll be promoting this in the SCP discord for a while to come.</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17449293/an-bhean-ar-arasan-2000">An Bhean ar Árasán 2000</a>

						 <p>Truth be told, I had a lot in my mind writing this page up, and surely looking at one's page and its potentialities would make most authors weep (me me me).</p> <p>About the worldbuilding, I suppose that the juxtaposition of life and death is the main caveat I was aiming for, and that's why I didn't do much focusing on the two worlds of the tale, but more at the boundaries between them, and I let them be simple and symbolic to distinguish more those boundaries.</p> <p>For the photographic notes, in my mind it has some implications.</p> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Potential&nbsp;spoilers.</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Close.</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>The Young One 's reluctance to let living beings approach it is a sign of trauma, caused by the fiends of the Dark Age. And yet, it still is capable of altruistic acts; it's learning to move on and welcome life again. The Elder was worried that it would be lonely. It will not be lonely.</p> <p>Even more, it allows Michael to pluck poppies from its chin. It's celebrating life, the birth of Michael's sister.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p>That being said, these aspects of a work is highly subjective, and I might have fell flat on some places. I'm happy to reflect on them. Your opinion is perfectly valid, and I shall respect it.</p> <p>Thanks for the reply, Wynths!</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17448267/level-878-the-lasting-warmth">Level 878 - &quot;The Lasting Warmth&quot;</a>

						 <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">+&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Detailled&nbsp;Review</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">-&nbsp;Close</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p><strong>technical execution: I mean this in the most granular and literal sense possible: on a sentence by sentence basis, how many of these would I pick out as good and memorable?</strong></p> <p>i will preface this by saying that i have a <em>disdain</em> for the particular kind of writing style embodied through out the majority of the piece: that is, writing which is based in zany metaphors (the Ouija board line), wild and wacky unintroduced elements (the magic bag), and a mix of action-based prose and comedic timing. that being said, it was well-executed for this style of writing, and though i thought that many lines were unnecessary, i do think that they allow the file to focus more on the comedy angle which it holds essential.</p> <p>there are, however, several spots where i feel like the voice that is intentionally used in this anomaly gives way to unintentional bad writing. here are some examples of what i mean:</p> <blockquote> <p>This room was a dead end, and the door was airtight. The locals must have known that because it was absolutely filled with fecal matter.</p> </blockquote> <p>this feels like it should transition more smoothly and actually set up the joke, since, as it is, this feels like a comment just thrown in for comedic value.</p> <blockquote> <p>It's got different rules from Earth. A lot of things need to be recycled. There isn't much to work with anymore, after all. Still, you get a little here and there. Anything that isn't composted, scrapped, or refurbished gets wheeled out of town.</p> </blockquote> <p>this feels like it's too redundant to actually be humourous &#8212; like, i'm reading this aloud in my head, and i don't buy someone actually saying this in the way i <em>might</em> buy someone saying the rest of this piece.</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm flatfooted, I walk loudly, and the halls down here resonate. In other words, I make a lot of noise. Noise that tends to attract Cracked Oberonians. And one of them had just found me.</p> </blockquote> <p>this feels like it's overly redundant in an attempt to be dramatic</p> <p>and little things like that pepper this page. however, in the grand scheme of things, much of this is excusable because of the zaniness this piece is obviously trying to capture; as such, while i don't like this style of writing, i won't let it affect my vote.</p> <p><strong>content: here, i'm referring to the narrative of the page &#8212; do I think it is memorable, consistent and unique? this also plays in with imagery: do I <em>feel</em> the narrative with what you choose to show me?</strong></p> <p>i think that the piece itself is perfectly suited for the writing style, and while i didn't necessarily like the twist, i think that it didn't affect the piece much &#8212; what it's really going for is capturing a distinct voice, and i feel like this piece was able to successfully capture that cliche, cheesy, almost- '50s noir detective voice here. it's written indulgently and excessively &#8212; <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/selenophilia" target="_blank">in much the same way I wrote my own Folklorecon entry, Selenophilia</a> &#8212; for something that <em>really</em> doesn't seem to merit it, but i find the piece fun and tasteful despite its intentionally childish voice. there isn't much in the way of theming that i can detect, but that's fine &#8212; this is comedy, and i think it's funny enough.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> while i don't think this piece appeals to me, i do think that it is sharply and smartly written for its audience, and as such, i feel charitable to it. it's pretty decent&#8230; and, i think it's site-worthy. +1!</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17444272/the-lone-sorcerer">The Lone Sorcerer</a>

this also plays in with imagery: do I <em>feel</em> the narrative with what you choose to show me?</strong></p> <p>now, i do think that the decision to make this like an old folktale, as Limdoc said, <em>was</em> a good idea; it plays well with the topic, and frankly, i think the format is dogshit and would not have been able to hold an article like this without significant distortion and workings-around. that being said, and with consideration to the tiny scope of the actual tale itself, i still think that this could and should have done more with the little time that it had.</p> <p>for one, i would have really liked to see more of an emphasis on the emotional arc of this character. like, they <em>almost drowned.</em> i feel like being able to use that and write about the genuine terror the character would have felt &#8212; being on solid ground one second and in peril the next &#8212; would have contrasted nicely with the euphoria of this tree yuri godddess descending down and kissing our main character. i also think that a brief snippet of the tree yuri goddess showing her true colors would have been pretty good and gone a long way in building an emotional arc for our protag. as it is, her death/maiming is lifeless, told to us as matter of fact rather than real and compassionate prose. this works in the SCP format and to a limited extent in the Backrooms format with enough contorting, but here, it just feels like a tonal mismatch &#8212; it doesn't come off like a fairytale warning, it comes off like an abrupt and unsatisfying jumpcut.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> while i appreciate the piece's ideas, and i do think that it makes sense that it is in its current state given its status as a 3-hour coldpost, i don't think this piece is the best that it can be, and i think that rewriting it to be much better <em>with criticism</em> will make a much better product with good technical execution. of course, i'm a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">little</span> hypocritical &#8212; my novella <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/selenophilia" target="_blank">Selenophilia</a> was a coldpost &#8212; but in my defense, that took more time than three hours, and it took <em>a lot</em> of beat from me in the limited time I was able to beat it with literary hammers :-)</p> <p>overall, I really would like to see this come back in some way, but in its current state, I feel like a -1 is most appropriate. it can be made better!</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17448265/entity-85-nymphs">Entity 85 - &quot;Nymphs&quot;</a>

						 <p>while it definitely isn't the best technically-executed work you've put out, I do think that this is passable in the technical sense and is Pretty Good in terms of its content, pacing, and imagery. I also think the creative decision to leave completely unexplained the Phenomenon was a great one &#8212; it's tempting to give at least a <em>thread</em> to explore, as I attempted to do in the narrative eleventh-hour of <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/selenophilia" target="_blank">Selenophilia</a>, but I think resisting that impulse allowed this piece to just focus on the experience of this traveller, which elevates the pacing and action by a considerable amount.</p> <p>now, let me elucidate those points above a bit more specifically:</p> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">+&nbsp;Open</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">-&nbsp;Close</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p><strong>technical execution: I mean this in the most granular and literal sense possible: on a sentence by sentence basis, how many of these would I pick out as good and memorable?</strong></p> <p>in this case, while i don't think that it's of the highest quality, i do think that it goes down fine, and is competently written to the point where i can pass the execution by. i do admit, though, that it has that &quot;no granular crit&quot; feel to it, with such examples as:</p> <blockquote> <p>I ran through the halls towards the stairwell that led to the Underseer's office, nearly slipping several times on the <strong>bloody</strong> puddles left behind from the chaos. I did my best not to look at the <strong>bloody</strong> numeric murals strewn across the walls, but the smell of <strong>blood</strong> was thick in the air.</p> </blockquote> <p>asking for word variety, even just a &quot;crimson&quot; or a &quot;sanguine&quot; :-)</p> <p><strong>content: here, i'm referring to the narrative of the page &#8212; do I think it is memorable, consistent and unique? this also plays in with imagery: do I <em>feel</em> the narrative with what you choose to show me?</strong></p> <p>now, i'm a sucker for disasters and zombie apocalypses like the common writer, and i do think that this does an excellent job playing off of the typical tropes of zombie-ness. the imagery of people contorting into different numbers, their tendons snapping apart with wet sounds and their minds collapsing, <em>is</em> pretty vivid. while i do think that it could and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should</span> be used as a device to hint at some greater thing (whether it be Monster That Kills You &quot;Mathematica Primus&quot;, or a more sincere attempt at social discourse), i don't think it's necessarily this piece's job to elevate the Counting Plague, despite its title, and as such i don't hold much against it on that front.</p> <p>what i <em>do</em> hold against it, however, is the predictability of the piece. IMO, although you use an image &#8212; zomebies &#8212; that is incredibly common and has established plotlines associated with it, you still have an obligation to give <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> unique spin on it. perhaps it could have been Mark having to find a way to break into Nate's office, then it being revealed that there was a portable terminal being held by a bunch of the zombies and Mark having to wear some earplugs and hack and slash through the mob, or perhaps pretend to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> one of them, only to have to resist the urge to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually</span> become one of them. just one idea!</p> <p>however, it's not the worst: there's some unexplored potential, but what <em>is</em> down here, as I said earlier, is competently written and fun to read.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p>with all the above considered, I give this a tentative +1. I think it could have done better, but as it is, I think it's site-worthy.</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17447392/phenomenon-71-the-counting-plague">Phenomenon 71 - &quot;The Counting Plague&quot;</a>

						 <p>I like this concept a lot. It's definitely not typical of the Backrooms but it works really well. My biggest issue with this page is in the wording. There's a lot of really beautiful stuff here but sometimes it feels a bit rigid. Could've done with a bit of crit to iron it out. Otherwise tho this is a really solid concept that's well executed. Also I'm a big fan of this being told like a tale. It's easy to take a concept like this and try to make it at least a little clinical but this story telling way of writing the page is perfect!</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17448265/entity-85-nymphs">Entity 85 - &quot;Nymphs&quot;</a>

						 <p>i'll second scut and lim here: getting the idea out is fine, and having this childish way of writing could be a compelling way to characterize its titular protagonist, but to do that, you would need imagery that is far more vivid and language that drips with novelty, two things which are not present here currently.</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17447383/poi-molly">POI - Molly</a>

						 <p>The poem is a bit short, and it doesn't do much original with the folk tale, playing it pretty straight to the point of summarization. I think the folk tale you picked has a lot of good potential as a Backrooms thing, and if you'd had the time to write your rice paddy level it might have turned out way better. As it stands, it's just got to be developed some more. You can also integrate the Buddhist aspect better, which I can't lie I didn't really cop when I read it. j</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17449071/what-she-tried-to-teach-me">What She Tried To Teach Me</a>

						 <p>7 and a half months ago, <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yossipossi" ><img class="small" src="https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=2199269&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763391119" alt="Yossipossi" style="background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=2199269)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yossipossi" >Yossipossi</a></span> might have, in a butterfly-effect-esque way, changed the course of my life for years to come.</p> <p>they published, entirely as a joke, the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/totally-legit-scp-anthology-2025" target="_blank">April Fool's SCP Anthology</a> &#8212; a collection of 31 parodic prompts that resembled the real anthology's themes. it was a goof, a gaffe &#8212; something that should have, in all respects, been uninterestingly good.</p> <p>that was not the case for me.</p> <p>I wrote the three parts of ACROPHILIA in four days, and it comprises about 12k words, being by far and away the best example I have for what one can do when possessed by the muse. of course, given the fact that I was a <em>brand</em> new author who had coldposted the articles out of nothing but bull-headed stubbornness (hey&#8230; that seems familiar. note that down for later, maybe.), the two tales went ignored, still holding less than +10 each while the SCP is in only slightly better shape, sitting at +25 as of writing.</p> <p>so, what did i learn from the whole &quot;rush production&quot; style of writing, and the obvious damage which it did to the potential reception of those articles?</p> <p>simple &#8212; i did it again.</p> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">+&nbsp;lengthy&nbsp;ramblings,&nbsp;1024&nbsp;words&nbsp;</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">-&nbsp;Close</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>i am both incredibly proud of Selenophilia for the monstrous amount of words i was able to put in while still keeping A Degree of quality, and the amount of Things and Ideas I was able to integrate into the whole project (so much so that, if this thing gets popular, i'll probably put out a &quot;director's cut&quot; version where i explain my moment-to-moment writing style and the Things and Ideas that influenced how this thing came out.)</p> <p>there are, of course, a couple of general things which i can talk about now &#8212; the first being, what to any wiki author must be, a sun-bright decision to <em>coldpost</em> this entire thing. while i cannot stress enough how much i do not <em>endorse</em> this sort of reckless and irresponsible behavior, i do feel like, in order to embark on some of my wildest and most <em>clearly</em> ROI-negative pieces, such as this one, coldposting serves as a way to make working on pieces like this &#8212; which i do find fun &#8212; worth it in my mind. i also think it encourages me, whenever time isn't <em>as</em> much a pressure, to give much tighter writing and editing to my pieces, as i don't have the incredibly luxury of having people look over it before i publish on the wiki. of course, this also means that pages don't come out with as even a quality as they could be &#8212; jagged edges will be transparent. regardless, in my <em>personal estimation</em>, this is worth it in order to be able to swallow the pill of, say, writing a 17.2k word piece on a site which is explicitly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> equipped for such bullshit.</p> <p>another couple things with regard the structure of the piece:<br /> 1) the poem at the end doesn't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessarily</span> have to be there, i'm well aware of that. the reason that i spent so much time on it anyways is because i felt like, in a story which primarily occurs in a world that is completely unrecognizable from <em>anything</em> on the site, being able to tie some familiarity to this world while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also</span> being able to characterize the titular Goddess and lay bare her incredible fucked-up-ed-ness, was something that would play well with the prose narrative. also, it was grandfahered in from&#8230;</p> <p>2) this thing was <em>not</em> intended to be a folklorecon piece. originally, it was going to be a standalone SCP written to fit more exactly onto the prompt given by the anthology. then, after a coauthored piece for 9kcon fell through due to my coauthor's mental health issues, i tried to hammer the thing into 9kcon worthy shape in about 5 days. it didn't work.</p> <p>then, during the voting period for 9kcon, i saw the announcement that folklorecon was going to happen, and the gears turned in my mind. as stated above, i am an avid fan of coldposting and regularly practice such nonsense myself. realizing that, if i was ever going to participate in the backrooms wiki, i <em>had</em> to have that option at my disposal, i knew that repurposing the 9kcon draft into a folklorecon draft would be the easiest way to ensure that i had something presentable in the timeframe allotted. so, i deleted the SCP portion and carried over the poem to a new backrooms sandbox. &quot;it shouldn't take that long &#8212; how much content can there be here? i want FOREFRONT interludes to be under 10k, i'll just make sure it stays there&quot;</p> <p>that sentiment was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish.</span> if there is something that i am an even stronger advocate for than the right to coldpost, it would be the right to be indulgent, poetic, and <em>hubristic</em> in prose. i had, at the outset of the draft, recently listened to a reading of Outer Dark (the Cormac novel) by Ed Sala, and i had <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>really</strong></span></em> enjoyed it &#8212; so much so that, in order to pay tribute to it <em>and</em> develop a new prosaic style, i decided to emulate cormac's mode of writing, taking his literary principles as i had observed them in Outer Dark and running for as long as i thought necessary. i directly attribute the length of Selenophilia / The Goddess to this.</p> <p>lastly, this piece was <em>so</em> massive to me not just because of the enormous effort that it represented, but because by posting it, i feel i have been able to redeem myself for the thing that started me down writing for the backrooms wiki. during duelcon, i wrote a grand total of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">24,000</span> words for a tale that i felt (and occasionally said) would be the Backrooms Equivalent of ADMONITION. i set out with that goal, writing it like i would a novel; lots of little observations and tangential asides which would hopefully inflate perceived quality, wordcount, and ratings. unfortunately, with that piece, i flew too close to the sun: despite a massive effort from myself, and some general crit from several people on my team, it was outside of my reach &#8212; and by a sizable margin too. by having this up, i feel that i have been able to show that, as a writer, i <em>am</em> improving, little by little.</p> <p>the ultimate goal that i'm working towards, with this series, is a book. i want to write something that will be remembered as good by many people, something that &#8212; even if it doesn't reach the gifted heights that gifted authors can attain &#8212; aspires to do more than entertain. that is my goal both for this wiki and for the SCP wiki (though the SCP wiki project will take yet more time than FOREFRONT, the series i'm pirouetting about).</p> <p>i hope i acheived this with Selenophilia. it's massive and unkempt and &#8212; i cannot stress this enough &#8212; probably features writing that would be laughed out the room if put before an actual copyeditor&#8230; but it's mine. i wrote it with coffee and determination alone, no input from anyone except on a single paragraph to gauge potential reader interest. knowing i was able to finish this <em>bolsters</em> me, it makes investing my time into writing feel worthy.</p> <p>i hope reading it is worthy to you.</p> </div> </div> </div> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17449019/selenophilia-the-goddess">Selenophilia / The Goddess</a>

						 <p>I like the concept, it's very cute. But you can't write something in 10 minutes without a lot of planning first</p> <p>When you write something short, you have to pack a lot in. Even if you tell the story in the simplest or shortest way, that'll be okay if the story itself is really compelling, original, and well-thought-out.</p> <p>So basically don't be disheartened, this was a quick project for you so of course it's gonna need some more work! But just try and spend some more time in the planning phase getting the story together and you'll be grand. Like Limdoc, I want to see this come back after some work 💛</p> <br/>Forum category: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-6898628">Meta / Per page discussions</a><br/>Forum thread: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-17447383/poi-molly">POI - Molly</a>

						 <p>This is confusing unfortunately. The POI is a ghost child written from the POV of said ghost child which is interesting but also this is severely underwhelming. Also we don't learn anything about this ghost child other than they're nice. This would benefit a lot from a rewrite.

						 <p>The story is fine. Your grammar still needs work. Also, there are no negative levels anymore. And I can't help but feel like this would be better if it was written as a phenomena instead.
