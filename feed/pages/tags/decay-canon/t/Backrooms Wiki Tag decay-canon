&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max continued down the hallway, tightly squeezing Macy’s hand. The sweltering heat of the boiler room was excruciating, even through the heatproof suits. He rushed air into his lungs, a vain attempt to manage the pain and cool down. The hallway grew hotter, tighter, and darker as they progressed. The group stayed in a harrowing silence, still processing the sight they had just seen. The sight of the explosion flashed through Max’s mind as the pain of the burns continued to crawl over his entire body. He felt a tear leak out of his eye, quickly evaporating into the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He squeezed Macy’s hand tighter as his breaths started to accelerate from stress. He had never been to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6&quot;&gt;Level 6&lt;/a&gt;, nor did he ever think he would go there. He remembered all of the horror stories of experienced M.E.G. agents who had narrowly survived this hellscape; it wasn’t something that left you quickly. They were different people: colder, more reserved. Horrid images flashed in his mind of what this twisted labyrinth would do to him, to his companions as well. He briefly glanced behind him at the distant, fading light of the boiler room hallway, taking one last look at them. He turned forward again to be greeted by pitch black darkness. His heart sunk as he the sweltering heat suddenly turned into a soulless, brisk cold. The feeling of Macy’s hand disappeared, replaced by the empty feeling of nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max waved his hand in front of his face, trying to gauge how much vision he had, but he saw nothing. He had officially entered level 6. He unzipped his suit and left it behind, no longer needing it. A feeling of dread creeped up his spine as he looked into the dark abyss. He grabbed a small flashlight from his backpack and attempted to shine it forward, but was shocked to see nothing. The darkness clearly overpowered any light he attempted to shine. He scoffed in frustration and chucked it into the abyss, hearing the loud clang of metal reverberate through the empty halls as he did so. The sound felt like an explosion in the otherwise dead silent room. His heart beat faster as he realized he shouldn’t have done that. Due to the lack of light, the M.E.G. have been unable to determine if Level 6 actually had any entities in it or if they were just hallucinations from the level’s environment. Remembering Alex’s advice, he quickly sipped the green Almond Water once more. The cold water felt good on his singed lips as it coated his dry, hoarse throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max extended his arms into the darkness, aimlessly bumbling around to find the walls of the place in order to have a better gauge of where he was going. He finally felt something, but it wasn’t the cold, metal wall he was expecting — it was soft and squishy, yet rough like sandpaper. He felt the object a little more, before suddenly running his fingers across a row of sharp, grooved, slightly wet objects. His eyebrow contorted in confusion as he tried to figure out what he was touching. His heart dropped as he heard a raspy moan come from where the object was. He gasped and quickly moved his hand away, finally connecting the dots. That was no wall, it was skin… and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max…” it groaned quietly. “Max…” it groaned again. He stumbled backwards, screaming at full volume like a teenage girl on a rollercoaster. He fell to the floor, causing a loud boom sound to reverberate through the room once again. The sound of his scream and the thud of his fall vibrated throughout the metal walls of the labyrinth of darkness. As the echoes faded, he slowly lowered his hands, confused why it had not attempted to attack him yet. The silence once again flooded the room. It was so quiet, he swore he could hear his own heartbeat. His breaths slowed as he sat up and remained still for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was that a hallucination?&lt;/em&gt; he wondered to himself. He began breathing faster as he entered a slight crisis over this question. &lt;em&gt;I felt it. I heard it. It said my name… but how could it have known my name? I haven’t said a word since I came here? And why didn’t it try to kill me?&lt;/em&gt; He suddenly caught himself spiraling and took deeper breaths, remembering what Alex said about this place and how easy it is to lose your mind in here. He took another sip of the almond water and recollected himself. He decided to instead try going to the wall from the floor. He felt around cold metal, waving his arms in a snow-angel motion. Eventually, he felt the cold, metal floor curve upwards, sighing in relief that he had finally found the wall. He used it to help himself to his feet, taking deep breaths in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped forward, clinging to the wall as his only way to know he was still walking forward. He brushed his singed and dry hands across the cold metal wall as he winced in pain. As time passed from the blast, the pain started to kick in and get progressively worse, and he was beginning to feel it. His back ached from the momentum of hitting the floor as well. The silence was causing his ears to ring, and losing the ability to see his own hand in front of his face was starting to get to him mentally. He knew he had to get out of here quickly, or he’d surely die within a few hours. He unscrewed the Almond Water bottle once again and took a much larger gulp, feeling much more satiated and awake afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started walking much faster, turning every corner with haste. Every second more he spent in this level, the more vulnerable he became. His fear began to turn to impatience and frustration. He remembered the day of his police training with Macy when they had to endure the pepper spray. They were expected run a full obstacle course with their guns in front of them, enduring and pushing through the pain of the pepper spray without faltering. This situation felt all too familiar: blind, painful, and the looming, crushing fear of failure over his head. He had people who were counting on him to make it through this, and he wasn’t going to fail. His heartbeat increased as the pressure started to get to him, and his eyes started to water. Suddenly, he remembered what Alex said to him in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1&quot;&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come. Don&#039;t expect me to always be there to save your sorry butts from trouble, and toughen up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wiped his tears and laughed. The memory was so vivid, he almost heard it through all the silence. He thought about what Alex would say to him if she were here. She’d probably call him a sissy or a loser for crying about the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a wimp. A broad, 6’1” cop blubbering about being alone in a dark room. What are you, five years old? Pull yourself together, you loser!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chuckled again under his breath, comforted by the thought of seeing his companions again soon. He collected himself emotionally and continued forward. He had to focus and remember both his M.E.G. training and police training. He attempted to listen carefully for the buzzing of electricity, knowing he had to find a wire on the floor to initiate entry into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1&quot;&gt;Level 6.1&lt;/a&gt;. The otherwise inaudible murmur of surges rushing through the cables, usually drowned out by every day noise, would be much easier to hear in this silent chamber of darkness. He listened very carefully, trying not to let the hallucinated ringing, the reverberating sounds of his footsteps, his heartbeat, or even the faint sound of fluids moving throughout his body drown out the noise. The sound suddenly caught his eardrums, although faint. He attempted to pursue it, listening very carefully as he approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound started to get closer and louder, and his adrenaline started rushing throughout his body as the possibility of escape finally seemed imminent. As he got closer and closer, a general sense of dread rushed over him, causing him to start breathing a little heavier. He assumed this was the ambience of the level messing with his head again, so he took some deep breaths and another sip of almond water. The feeling didn’t go away, causing him to start freaking out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a loud screech pierced his ears. He covered his ears in pain, as going hours in mostly silence caused the loud noise to feel much more painful than it would in normal circumstances. The echoes of the scream vibrated along the hard, metal walls, fully drowning out the faint sound of electricity. His heart dropped into his stomach as he processed what he just heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That sounded like Macy…&lt;/em&gt; he thought. &lt;em&gt;No… Alex said it’s impossible to encounter another human in this place. It’s just another hallucination.&lt;/em&gt; Another shrill screech echoed through the metal halls, this time far closer than the previous. Max’s heart began pounding like an engine at this point as he froze in fear. He began hyperventilating and sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max! Max! Help us!” the voice yelled. It undeniably sounded like Macy at this point. He grabbed his bottle of almond water quickly unscrewed the cap, his hands shaking in fear. He began to chug what was left of the water, trying to regain his composure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAX! HELP US!” screamed two voices this time. It sounded like both Macy and Alex in unison. Max stumbled backwards the surprise. His ears began to rang as his heart pounded like it was trying to break free from his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not real… it’s not real… it’s not real!” he mumbled. “I’m sorry!” Max turned away from the voice and ran away. He heard the booms of large footsteps following him as he ran for his life. The two voices repeated, slowly growing more distorted as he ran. He screamed in pain as he ran full force into a metal wall, falling backwards as his momentum brought him to a screeching halt. His adrenaline prevented him from faltering, however, and he jumped back up and kept running. He screamed at the top of his lungs in fear for help in a final act of desperation. His legs burned in pain from all of the sprinting he had been doing. The loud footsteps grew closer and closer and closer until suddenly he felt his foot catch on something. He yelled as he felt himself falling, closing his eyes as he prepared to die. He put his arms out to brace for impact wondering if the creature would get him before he even hit the ground. Thumping and thumping and thumping as it got closer, closer, closer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max’s eyelids were suddenly bombarded with a flash of light. He squinted them open in confusion, groaning in pain from all his injuries. He looked up to faintly see a blurry group of people standing over him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Am I dead? Is this hell?” he muttered with a hoarse voice. The group gasped in shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s alive? How?” he heard one of them whisper. Max sat up, still struggling to adjust to the bright lights above him after being in pitch black for so long. It was a relief to be able to see again, and a wave of comfort washed over him. He saw one of them reach their hand out to offer him help to stand. He hesitantly accepted the gesture and came to his feet. He rubbed his eyes and finally looked around to assess his new location, realizing he had made it into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1&quot;&gt;Level 6.1&lt;/a&gt;. He turned to look at the group of people surrounding him and gasped in shock. All of them were 7-foot-tall humanoids with TVs for heads. They wore aprons and gloves and had antennas sticking out of the top of their TVs. He stumbled back, not expecting to see such a sight. The creatures themselves also seemed to be a little surprised by his reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, please. You’re covered in bruises and burns! Let us help you!” one of them exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, I really shouldn’t be surprised at this point. And yet, here we are…” he mumbled under his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, apologies for the sudden disturbance. I can assure you we have nothing but good intentions.” another one said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who… what… are you?” he asked defensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe the M.E.G. refers to us as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-132&quot;&gt;Entity 132&lt;/a&gt;, but that designation feels a little demeaning, in my opinion; we’ll circle back to that later. We are employees of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-remodeling-co&quot;&gt;Backrooms Remodeling Co&lt;/a&gt;. at your service. Please, follow us to the building nearby so that we can be of assistance.” One of them tried to put their arm around his shoulder to help him walk, but Max slapped it away. He yelled in pain as soon as he did this, grabbing his arm and groaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sir, we wish not to harm you. Your body is covered in burns, you have multiple broken bones, several bruises, and you’re in shock. You’ve been through a lot, and we want to help heal you,” another one pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do I know I can trust you?” Max asked hesitantly. The TV head whom he had slapped slowly reached his hand out and placed it over one of Max’s burns on his arm. He covered it up for a moment, and then lifted it up. Max was shocked to see that the burn had disappeared, along with the pain in that specific area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can help you. Please, sir, I implore you to come with us. You do not have the bandwidth to wander around by yourself.” At this point, Max finally let his guard down and began to breathe normally. The shock of everything he had just endured suddenly overwhelmed him, and he felt his eyelids growing heavy as he fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max woke up once again to a warm sensation throughout his whole body. The pain that he had been dealing with since the explosion in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1&quot;&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; was notably absent. He opened his eyes to realize he was sitting in a large bath of warm water in the middle of an empty restaurant. He looked around in confusion wondering how he had gotten into this situation. He looked around wondering what happened to his backpack and clothes, only to see them folded neatly on the floor next to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello? TV guys? Are you there?” he yelled out. He saw one of them peak their head inside the entrance of the restaurant and beckon for the rest to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange beings wandered in single file and surrounded the tub. He awkwardly squirmed around in the water and covered his exposed self. Now that he had come to his senses, Max was able to finally get a good look at them. They were certainly very interesting beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, there were four of them. They towered over Max, despite the fact he himself was fairly tall himself. They all wore fancy clothes with gloves and an apron. One wore a blue plaid shirt with a black tie and khaki pants. A name tag saying “Frank” was present next to the tie — presumably his name. The next was Melanie, who wore a pink blouse and jeans. The third was Brittany, who wore a black, long-sleeved polo shirt and black cargo pants with dress shoes. The final was Ralph, who was the shortest of the four, yet still far taller than Max. He wore a purple, short-sleeved polo with khakis and slacks. Max was still in awe over their uncanny appearance: so human, yet so foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, you’re awake.” Melanie held up a small mirror. “Everything feeling alright? Is the water of appropriate rejuvenating temperature? All your ducks in a row, and such?” Max looked at his face in the mirror in awe. Every pimple, blackhead, and acne scar had disappeared. His skin looked like it had a social media beauty filter applied to it in real life. He looked down at the rest of his body, realizing the scars, stretch marks, burns, bruises, and other injuries and impurities had disappeared. He used his tongue to feel the back of his mouth, and was shocked to find even his wisdom teeth had appeared back in his mouth, perfectly aligned in his mouth without causing damage to his other teeth. Despite being removed in high school for being indented, they felt as if they had been there all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My… body… how in the world did you-” Max stammered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apologies, I don’t believe we formally introduced ourselves. As mentioned, the M.E.G. has designated us as Entity 132. We work for the Backrooms Remodeling Company and have been sent to assist with the situation in The Snackrooms, or 6.1 as you refer to it,” Frank explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to fix things that are flawed and make them better. Typically, we section off parts of a level to improve it and fix its impurities, along with generally improving it overall. Levels are usually all we deal with, but we can do the same with humans as well,” Melanie continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You were very badly injured when you fell through the roof in front of us. We thought everyone had been evacuated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;The City&lt;/a&gt; by now, and were surprised to find a straggler. Where did you even come from?” Brittany asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max’s heart dropped when he realized The M.E.G. had completely vacated the level. Level 6.1 was one of the only safe havens in the Backrooms, but unlike Level 11, this place was not protected by the 11 effect. As a result, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-67&quot;&gt;Partygoers&lt;/a&gt; noticed this vulnerability and have been attempting to invade the level for many years. Armed guards were stationed around the clock to ensure this nightmare scenario never occurred, as it was considered one of the worst possible case scenarios that the group could endure. He tried to forget about this, hoping The Decay would deter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was stuck in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5&quot;&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt;, and the only way out was into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6&quot;&gt;Level 6&lt;/a&gt; through the boiler room. The plan was to get here through that level,” Max responded. The group gasped and looked at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Level 6? Lights out? My word, you went through Lights Out with nothing but a backpack and survived? You are fortunate. Almost everyone who goes in there loses their mind from the vivid hallucinations. No wonder you were in such bad shape…” Ralph murmured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You were on the verge of death, sir. You’re lucky you landed next to us like you did, or else you may have perished!” Brittany exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fixing humans is always fun. We tried our best not to go too crazy and fix &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; like your belly button and your circumcision,” Melanie said. Max blushed with extreme embarrassment, awkwardly looking at the group with immense discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mel! What did we talk about? Humans hate it when you tell them about their anatomy. Get your ducks in a row and work on your professionalism! The higher-ups would not be pleased!” Ralph exclaimed, slightly whacking Melanie on the shoulder. Max stared at the odd group with profound confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ok, I’m sorry. Thank you for helping me, but I need to go find my friends. Have you seen a talking blue bird, a tall white lady with a pony tail, a slightly chubby black lady in a blue robe, a nasty looking lady with super long, greasy hair, or a crusty old man in a ridiculous bird costume running around here, by chance? We all got separated when we entered Level 6, and I need to make sure they’re okay!” Max pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apologies, sir. We have not seen anyone other than you since the evacuation. However, The Snackrooms are quite immense. It is possible some of them may be wandering around here,” Brittany explained. Max sighed, still unsure if the voices he was hearing in Level 6 were real or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait, wait, wait. Evacuation? What are you talking about?” Max asked. The group was silent for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The higher-ups ordered us to come here and evacuate the residents due to a sudden presence of a troublesome black void that is slowly progressing through levels and consuming everything in its path without prejudice. The M.E.G. has designated it as The Decay. They knew we were the best candidates to stop it due to our synergy, and the remaining M.E.G. agents throughout the level evacuated all the residents while we set up Reality Fresheners, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-32&quot;&gt;Object 32&lt;/a&gt; as you call them, in front of where The Decay currently is. As suspected, it seems to have stopped it in its path, but we need to figure out now how to reverse the damage it has done. We’re kind of boiling the ocean right now with trying to figure this out, and we’re kind of lacking the bandwidth to effectively dive into this, but it’s the best the company can offer at this time,” Ralph responded. All of the heavily forced corporate jargon from these weirdos was starting to give Max a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Goodness… I was trying to get back to Level 11 to inform the Oversight Council about the decay, but it’s progressed way faster than I expected. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt; is probably fully consumed by now at this rate. I wanna see it. I have some research data that may help you out!” Max responded. “Just… um. Do you have a towel?” Frank scurried over to a nearby closet and handed Max a towel as he stood up from the tub, dripping wet. He covered himself awkwardly, still embarrassed to be fully exposed in front of 4 total strangers. He dried himself off and redressed himself quickly, gathering his belongings into his backpack and pockets once again. He was unsettled by the expressionless, black screens that these creatures had for heads. They at least &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; nice, but he was far from trusting them. Once he was ready, he followed the group out of the restaurant and down the long hallway of restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of dread washed over him as he walked down the empty hallway. He had never seen this level so abandoned before. Usually, it was bustling with activity, trading, settlers, and M.E.G. operatives yelling at unruly people. He wasn’t sure if it was the dampness in his hair or the dread, but a chill crawled up his back as he saw this horrifying sight. The threat of an invasion also remained in the back of his mind, giving him some anxiety. The TV heads stopped as they reached a corner and turned around, looking at Max. Due to the absence of facial features, Max had a difficult time reading what they were thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Around this corner is where The Decay has stopped. We’ve been heavily monitoring it since we arrived, and our state of the art Reality Refereshers are working wonderfully! It hasn’t moved an inch since then!” Brittany explained excitedly. Max covered his nose as he was bombarded by the overwhelming scent of mangoes. He took a deep breath as he stared into the cold, dark void before him. The objects, which were plugged into the wall, sprayed a thick blue mist around the entire area which created a haze. Still, the unforgiving darkness of The Decay pierced his pupils like knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is it alright. The unstoppable force that killed my friends…” Max said solemnly as the visions of the explosion flooded his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You said you were able to stop it, correct? What did you discover?” Frank asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well… we threw various different objects at it in an attempt to discover a way to stop it. We thought that &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4&quot;&gt;Object 4&lt;/a&gt; worked, but when we tried to use it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1&quot;&gt;Level 5.1&lt;/a&gt;, it was a dismal failure. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-47&quot;&gt;Object 47&lt;/a&gt;, however, specifically the black variant, has proven temporarily effective twice. If only you could somehow create a permanent source of black bottled lightning, that could potentially work…” Max replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Deculidators and Black Lightning. The former has quite similar, though inferior, properties to our Reality Fresheners. The latter, however, is quite interesting. Perhaps overwhelming it with unfathomable amounts of energy like Black Bottled Lightning provides is how to stop it…” Mel commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have any left?” Ralph asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, one left. Sinclair had 3, and gave me 2 for the tests. It’s very rare, and she collected those 3 over years of pilfering &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3&quot;&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve used two, already. Given that Level 3 is probably long gone by now, make it count. This may very well be the last one in existence…” Max said solemnly. He grabbed the bottle from his bag and placed it in Frank’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your donation is very appreciated. I will develop a new prototype of a Reality Refresher that will stop The Decay once and for all!” Frank exclaimed excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be careful — and whatever you do, do not open it. We’ll all die immediately if you do. It’s one of the most powerful objects in The Backrooms. Put it to good use,” Max ordered sternly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Worry not. We’re plenty familiar with this. It’s so powerful that opening the bottle will not be necessary. Just the residual static electricity is enough to channel for what we have in mind,” Mel replied confidently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How long will this take you?” Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A few hours. Once The Snackrooms are secure, we can then attempt to meet with The Oversight Council to discuss our success with them, and work on securing The City as well. The Backrooms Remodeling Co can develop a partnership with The M.E.G. to ensure humanity’s survival, and everything will be okay,” Brittany asserted confidently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m glad you’re confident. Someone on 11 &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to have some lying around somewhere. And if not, at least 6.1 will be safe…” Max sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right then. Feel free to be on your way to The City, and we will follow you to Base Beta at our earliest convenience. Thank you for working with the Backrooms Remodeling Company!” Frank replied, suddenly reverting to his corporate accent he had when they first met. Max smiled awkwardly and nodded in gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max walked back into the restaurant containing the tub and started packing his things into his sack. Frank walked in, tinkering with the reality refresher in his hands, looking up at Max as he approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are all of your ducks in a row, then? Just wanted to check on you!” Frank said with a painfully forced corporate tone. All of the forced professional jargon was giving him flashbacks to his college internship in an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh, yeah. I’m just packing my stuff. Thank you again for, uh… fixing me, I suppose,” Max replied shallowly. Frank sat in a nearby chair next to Max, still tinkering with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I just ask, if it’s alright, what led you to join The M.E.G. as fodder?” Frank asked. Max was taken aback by the blunt question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Similar reason as most other people, honestly. I survived Level 0 by the skin of my teeth, and when I made it into Level 1, The M.E.G. was there to save me. During my time there, they presented me with a choice: live quietly on Level 11 like normal, begging for scraps in 6.1… or join their cause and get guaranteed housing, food, pay, and the such. Back on Earth, I was a police officer. I suppose I’ve always had the propensity for risking my life for the greater good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank nodded longingly. It was hard to tell his emotion from the fact he didn’t have a face, but his body language was noticeably sad. “Admittedly, I’ve always disliked The M.E.G. It’s not because I’m hateful or rooting for your downfall, but I’m jealous…” Frank mumbled, ceasing the forced corporate jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How so?” Max asked inquisitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I… &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were created, we are born knowing exactly what we are meant to do and our life’s purpose. We are what we are made to be, and that is it. This suit, this tie, these machines — all of it is what I am. If that’s the case, if it’s what I’m supposed to be, I sometimes wonder why I want to be something else so badly. When you came here, you were granted the opportunity to choose your path and decide what you wanted to be. I, on the other hand, do not…” Frank replied solemnly. Max was quiet, feeling sympathetic for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What stops you from just abandoning it all?” Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My loyalty is to the higher-ups. They are my creator. They are everything to me. It is my duty to serve them, and their will is superior to mine. Even though I want to be free, I also want to be loyal to the one who made me. If they want me to be this, then that is what I am, but that doesn’t stop me from wishing I could have both…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re saying you want to join The M.E.G.?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Something else… As servants to the higher-ups, we are told we are not allowed to choose for ourselves what we want to be. As a result, love is forbidden, as they believe it is disgusting and dangerous. Understanding this, I’ve tried so hard to resist, but… every time I see Mel, I can’t help but look at her. She’s so beautiful, and I want to be with her, but I’m not even supposed to feel this way. If it’s not allowed, why am I hardwired this way? Why are feelings I can’t control wrong?” Frank asked. His screen began to fade into static, surprising Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to put yourself through this. I can take you to 11 with me. You can be free from these higher-ups and live there. You can be whoever and whatever you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No… As I said, my loyalty is to the higher-ups. They are my creators, and I want to serve them. If serving them means depriving myself of these feelings, I am happy to suffer in their name. They always say they give their most difficult projects to their strongest employees,” Frank replied assertively. White noise began to come loudly out of his TV as Frank’s hand curled into a fist. The other one, which held the Reality Refresher, began to shake. Max was silent for a moment, processing what he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could love be evil? Why is what I am an abomination? Why was I made like this?” Frank asked, his voice stammering and breaking as the volume of the white noise grew progressively louder. “I didn’t choose to be like this… Why am I a monster simply for how I feel? I- I just… I’d rather be free.” Max looked at him with fervent empathy and began to feel incredibly sorry for him. Faintly, Max almost thought he could hear the sound of crying underneath the white noise. Before he could respond, the white noise suddenly stopped, and Frank twitched back into a firm stance. He stood up and turned to Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I apologize, it seems I went defective for a moment there. Melanie, Ralph, and Brittany would like to wish you safe travels.” Frank quickly walked out of the restaurant and turned the corner towards the others. Max stared at the wall solemnly in silence. Until now, he was disturbed by the strange personalities of the TV Heads, but now he felt horrible for Frank. He grabbed his bag and followed Frank to the others. He turned the corner to see them all working hard on reprogramming the Reality Refreshers to make full use of the Bottled Lightning. He wanted to say something, but was afraid of making Frank upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah yes, Max! Are you all prepared to leave?” Brittany asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, thank you guys again for helping me and humanity. I’ll talk to the Base Leader in Level 11 to start returning people to the level. I’ll also let them know of y’all’s good deeds and ensure you are both helped and rewarded adequately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great to hear. The exit to The City is about a 3-minute walk down the corridor,” Melanie replied, pointing in the direction of the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you get lost and need directions, let us know!” Ralph replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Safe travels!” all four of them replied in unison, freaking Max out. He waved with an awkward smile and waved. Before he could even turn around to head towards Level 11, Max heard the loud sound of a bird squawk echo through the long hall of 6.1. He quickly turned around to see &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-7&quot;&gt;Jerry&lt;/a&gt; flying around the corner and landing on Max’s shoulder. He had a worried expression on his face, breathing heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jerry! What’s going on? Where are the others?” Max asked with concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You stupid Meggies have always been so incompetent!” he squawked with resentment. “Where are all the guards you people have stationed here?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They evacuated to 11 because of this!” Max exclaimed, pointing at The Decay. “What’s happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good going. Because of you idiotic clowns not doing your job, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-67&quot;&gt;The Partygoers&lt;/a&gt; have taken the opportunity to invade The Snackrooms. About ten of them have emerged to scope the scene, and they’re heading this way. If we hurry, we can escape before they block the exit!” Max’s heart dropped. He had never seen a partygoer before, but he was more than familiar with what they were capable of. One touch, and he was as good as dead. This nightmare, the worst possible case scenario in regards to human safety, had just come true. Max froze as his mind rushed through all the implications and effects of what this meant moving forward… if and when The Decay was ever stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to get out of here now. This level is no longer salvageable!” Max screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you still doubt our abilities? We can finish this device very quickly, and all of our products wor-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CAN IT!” Max screamed, interrupting Melanie. “Entity 67 is not something I’m messing with. This is one of the primary scenarios that The M.E.G. was trying to avoid! We’d need an entire army to stop them!” Max started running back down the hallway, hoping to beat the partygoers to the door to Level 11. As soon as he turned the corner, he was greeted by the sight of 3 partygoers rapidly approaching him. Their legs shuffled against each other as they moved, extending their arms outward to show the teeth at the end of their stubs. Small holes were indented into their heads resembling a horrifying smiley face, with red stains around them resembling blood. Whether it was human or not was impossible to tell. Max’s heart began pounding out of his chest at the mere sight of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you waiting for? Do something!” Jerry exclaimed. Without any further hesitation, Max swung his backpack around his shoulder. He reached in and grabbed a large chunk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-15&quot;&gt;Firesalt&lt;/a&gt; and clutched it in his hand. He hurled it towards the floor in front of the monsters and braced himself as it immediately burst into a small explosion. He breathed a sigh of relief as he realized the explosion took all 3 of them out, reducing them to a singed pile of guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to get out of here n-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On your right!” Jerry exclaimed again, interrupting Max. Max looked to the right to see another Partygoer peeking out through a window, pointing a crossbow at his head. Max moved his head to the side as the creature shot the bolt, ruffling his hair as it passed mere centimeters above the top of his ear. He turned back towards the TV heads as the arrow flew past him and right towards Frank’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Max could even say anything, the crossbow bolt pierced the screen of Frank’s head. The glass that made up the screen of his TV shattered immediately, causing Frank to fly backwards from the impact. Max covered his mouth in shock as Frank’s body went limp and flew back into The Decay from the impact of the arrow, falling into the void and disappearing. A tear dropped as he watched the being fly backwards into the abyss. He would never be able to confess his love to Melanie, live a life of choice and freedom, or be free of his prison of morality. Time seemingly froze as the bottle he held flew from his hands and fell towards the floor. Max dove like a soccer goalie around the corner of the wall before the bottle broke, fully aware of what was about to occur. As his body slammed onto the floor, the sound of the small bottle hitting the floor pierced his eardrum like a knife as he prepared for what was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottle shattered on impact, releasing the powerful lightning instantly. The lightning scattered around the entire area, electrocuting Melanie, Brittany, and Ralph. The Reality Refreshers that were plugged into nearby outlets also burst apart from the power of the lightning, causing the blue liquid contained inside to pour out onto the floor. The power from the blast likewise knocked the other three TV heads into the decay, killing them immediately. The lightning bounced around the room, also electrocuting and immediately killing the archer partygoer. Max used the rush from adrenaline to react quickly and run into a nearby restaurant before the residual electricity reached him. He slid onto the ground into the fetal position, crying and hyperventilating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry flew above him, carefully scouting the scene as Max shielded himself on the floor. He flew around the corner with care to avoid the residual sparks to see that the TV heads had all been killed immediately. Perhaps more shocking was the Reality Refreshers and the Bottled Lightning being destroyed. It was incredibly unlikely there were any more of either of those objects left lying around. Even if there were any left, the only ones who knew how to utilize them for their intended goal were gone. The thought was harrowing as Jerry realized that one way or another, humanity would never be able to safely enter Level 6.1 ever again. His thoughts were interrupted by a shriek from Max around the corner. He flew back around to see a group of 5 partygoers entering the room Max was now trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max grabbed a set of shurikens from his bag and threw them at one of the partygoers, lodging them in its head. To Max’s shock, the creature hardly flinched and kept approaching Max with the others. He grabbed his taser stick that was attached to his waist and extended it, yelling as he whacked the foremost one as hard as he could. The volts of electricity jumped around its body and caused it to collapse. The other four stopped for a moment to look at it, but did not falter. Max ran to the back of the restaurant, clutching the corner of the wall. Max frantically tried throwing more shurikens at the wretched creatures, but they were useless. In a last ditch effort, he took what was left of his Almond Water and splashed it on the creatures, hoping it would have a similar effect as it had on Jerry. Unsurprisingly, this was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jerry!” Max screamed. “Tell the others I’m sorry! Tell them I tried to save everyone! Tell Alex I-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Max could finish, a comically large sword suddenly appeared behind the hoard and sliced the remaining 4 creatures in half. The upper halves slightly flew up into the air as the bottom halves fell limp. Max looked up to see Father Bluebird coldly staring down at the corpses. His piercing gaze shot out from the darkness caused by his hood and mask, still giving Max a slight chill. He was relieved to see him, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Father Bluebird! You’re alive!” Jerry squawked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I apologize for the delay, your greatness. Level 6 posed quite a challenge, even for someone with the mental fortitude as I.” Max almost snickered at the irony of this statement, briefly forgetting the deadly situation he was in. “It seems The Partygoers have infiltrated this level. We must evacuate to The City immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he spoke with Jerry, Max noticed the partygoer he had hit earlier start to get up and approach Father Bluebird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Watch out!” he exclaimed. As Father Bluebird turned around, he didn’t have time to even begin to react to the creature’s approach before a small firesalt explosion killed it instantly, launching the corpse forward towards Father Bluebird. He groaned in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What was that you wanted to tell me?” a familiar voice asked. Max smiled to see Alex and Sinclair standing side by side in the threshold of the restaurant. Max beamed in relief knowing that they were all okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You guys! You’re-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Save the gushy stuff for later. We got a popsicle stand to blow,” Alex interrupted. Without hesitation, the group charged down the hallway in the direction of the nearest sliding glass door. A group of about 15 more partygoers swarmed the area, entering from an hole that had been blasted through the wall; Max was shocked to see the others charging right into the crowd without hesitation. Father Bluebird effortlessly sliced through them like butter, impaling them with impeccably precise and speedy blows. Max was still awestruck by his agility in spite of his age. Sinclair employed her usual arsenal of offensive objects, hurling an array of miscellaneous weapons into the crowd to take out some of the ones deeper into the crowd. Alex assisted Father Bluebird with her taser stick to ensure he didn’t get overwhelmed and watch his six. Jerry soared above the crowd to see Macy standing at the glass door they intended to reach, using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-19&quot;&gt;Squirt Gun&lt;/a&gt; to man off the monsters trying to transform her. Macy saw Jerry in the air and realized the crowd was close, yelling for them to follow her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re almost there! Keep going!” Jerry squawked. Sinclair grabbed a glass bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-44&quot;&gt;Cashew Water&lt;/a&gt; from her pouch and hurled it forward upwards, causing it to shatter on the ceiling. The contents of the glass bottle poured into the group of remaining partygoers, immediately causing several of them to fall to the ground limp. This revealed that the door was now right in front of them. Father Bluebird took one last big swing with his sword to slice any remaining creatures that did not get impacted by the Cashew Water, creating a physical opening. Without hesitation, Alex, Max, and Father Bluebird dove into the glass door and disappeared into the white light that emitted from it. Jerry quickly swooped in from the air. Sinclair stepped over the corpses and paralyzed partygoers and turned around, her back to the door. She turned around to the hole in the wall to see an unfathomably large swarm of partygoers coming through the hole en masse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go in, Macy. I’m not letting these sick beasts live get away scot free,” Sinclair snarled. Macy obliged immediately. Sinclair reached into her pouch to pull out a small grenade filled with &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-20&quot;&gt;Rixa Gas&lt;/a&gt;. Sinclair pulled the pin, hurled it into the group of partygoers in front of her, aiming for the hole. She immediately fell backwards into the door, slamming it shut behind her. As she felt her body noclipping through reality, she saw the gas quickly spread throughout the crowd, narrowly avoiding inhaling it herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max felt his body slam onto hot, black pavement, groaning in pain. He pushed himself up, looking around to see his friends in the same position. He looked behind him to see one of the restaurants used to enter 6.1 behind him, realizing he had successfully entered Level 11. He looked in front of him to see a skinny woman with purple hair looking down at him. She had a cold expression on her face, and her suit implied she meant business. Max looked up in confusion at the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, did we fall onto you? We were just trying to get out of 6.1, and-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did you not listen to the evacuation orders that were provided to you?” she responded coldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Long story actually. I-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Save it. You’re Max Blackfield, correct?” the woman interrupted again. Max sighed in annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. And who are you supposed to be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overseer B,” she boomed back coldly. Max’s heart dropped. “Quite bold of you to show your face here after your little stunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, what?!” Max exclaimed in disbelief. Overseer B took a small flask of Almond Water from her pocket and unscrewed the cap. Without hesitation, she splashed the contents on Jerry, causing him to fall to the floor and scream in agony like before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are under arrest for conspiring with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/followers-of-jerry&quot;&gt;Followers of Jerry&lt;/a&gt; to cause widespread destruction across several different levels. You’re going to pay for the grievous crimes you’ve committed against humankind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

The sweltering heat of the boiler room was excruciating, even through the heatproof suits. He rushed air into his lungs, a vain attempt to manage the pain and cool down. The hallway grew hotter, tighter, and darker as they progressed. The group stayed in a harrowing silence, still processing the sight they had just seen. The sight of the explosion flashed through Max’s mind as the pain of the burns continued to crawl over his entire body. He felt a tear leak out of his eye, quickly evaporating into the heat.</p> <p>He squeezed Macy’s hand tighter as his breaths started to accelerate from stress. He had never been to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6">Level 6</a>, nor did he ever think he would go there. He remembered all of the horror stories of experienced M.E.G. agents who had narrowly survived this hellscape; it wasn’t something that left you quickly. They were different people: colder, more reserved. Horrid images flashed in his mind of what this twisted labyrinth would do to him, to his companions as well. He briefly glanced behind him at the distant, fading light of the boiler room hallway, taking one last look at them. He turned forward again to be greeted by pitch black darkness. His heart sunk as he the sweltering heat suddenly turned into a soulless, brisk cold. The feeling of Macy’s hand disappeared, replaced by the empty feeling of nothingness.</p> <p>Max waved his hand in front of his face, trying to gauge how much vision he had, but he saw nothing. He had officially entered level 6. He unzipped his suit and left it behind, no longer needing it. A feeling of dread creeped up his spine as he looked into the dark abyss. He grabbed a small flashlight from his backpack and attempted to shine it forward, but was shocked to see nothing. The darkness clearly overpowered any light he attempted to shine. He scoffed in frustration and chucked it into the abyss, hearing the loud clang of metal reverberate through the empty halls as he did so. The sound felt like an explosion in the otherwise dead silent room. His heart beat faster as he realized he shouldn’t have done that. Due to the lack of light, the M.E.G. have been unable to determine if Level 6 actually had any entities in it or if they were just hallucinations from the level’s environment. Remembering Alex’s advice, he quickly sipped the green Almond Water once more. The cold water felt good on his singed lips as it coated his dry, hoarse throat.</p> <p>Max extended his arms into the darkness, aimlessly bumbling around to find the walls of the place in order to have a better gauge of where he was going. He finally felt something, but it wasn’t the cold, metal wall he was expecting — it was soft and squishy, yet rough like sandpaper. He felt the object a little more, before suddenly running his fingers across a row of sharp, grooved, slightly wet objects. His eyebrow contorted in confusion as he tried to figure out what he was touching. His heart dropped as he heard a raspy moan come from where the object was. He gasped and quickly moved his hand away, finally connecting the dots. That was no wall, it was skin… and teeth.</p> <p>“Max…” it groaned quietly. “Max…” it groaned again. He stumbled backwards, screaming at full volume like a teenage girl on a rollercoaster. He fell to the floor, causing a loud boom sound to reverberate through the room once again. The sound of his scream and the thud of his fall vibrated throughout the metal walls of the labyrinth of darkness. As the echoes faded, he slowly lowered his hands, confused why it had not attempted to attack him yet. The silence once again flooded the room. It was so quiet, he swore he could hear his own heartbeat. His breaths slowed as he sat up and remained still for a moment.</p> <p><em>Was that a hallucination?</em> he wondered to himself. He began breathing faster as he entered a slight crisis over this question. <em>I felt it. I heard it. It said my name… but how could it have known my name? I haven’t said a word since I came here? And why didn’t it try to kill me?</em> He suddenly caught himself spiraling and took deeper breaths, remembering what Alex said about this place and how easy it is to lose your mind in here. He took another sip of the almond water and recollected himself. He decided to instead try going to the wall from the floor. He felt around cold metal, waving his arms in a snow-angel motion. Eventually, he felt the cold, metal floor curve upwards, sighing in relief that he had finally found the wall. He used it to help himself to his feet, taking deep breaths in the process.</p> <p>He stepped forward, clinging to the wall as his only way to know he was still walking forward. He brushed his singed and dry hands across the cold metal wall as he winced in pain. As time passed from the blast, the pain started to kick in and get progressively worse, and he was beginning to feel it. His back ached from the momentum of hitting the floor as well. The silence was causing his ears to ring, and losing the ability to see his own hand in front of his face was starting to get to him mentally. He knew he had to get out of here quickly, or he’d surely die within a few hours. He unscrewed the Almond Water bottle once again and took a much larger gulp, feeling much more satiated and awake afterwards.</p> <p>He started walking much faster, turning every corner with haste. Every second more he spent in this level, the more vulnerable he became. His fear began to turn to impatience and frustration. He remembered the day of his police training with Macy when they had to endure the pepper spray. They were expected run a full obstacle course with their guns in front of them, enduring and pushing through the pain of the pepper spray without faltering. This situation felt all too familiar: blind, painful, and the looming, crushing fear of failure over his head. He had people who were counting on him to make it through this, and he wasn’t going to fail. His heartbeat increased as the pressure started to get to him, and his eyes started to water. Suddenly, he remembered what Alex said to him in the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1">casino</a>.</p> <p><em>You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come. Don't expect me to always be there to save your sorry butts from trouble, and toughen up.</em></p> <p>He wiped his tears and laughed. The memory was so vivid, he almost heard it through all the silence. He thought about what Alex would say to him if she were here. She’d probably call him a sissy or a loser for crying about the dark.</p> <p><em>What a wimp. A broad, 6’1” cop blubbering about being alone in a dark room. What are you, five years old? Pull yourself together, you loser!</em></p> <p>He chuckled again under his breath, comforted by the thought of seeing his companions again soon. He collected himself emotionally and continued forward. He had to focus and remember both his M.E.G. training and police training. He attempted to listen carefully for the buzzing of electricity, knowing he had to find a wire on the floor to initiate entry into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">Level 6.1</a>. The otherwise inaudible murmur of surges rushing through the cables, usually drowned out by every day noise, would be much easier to hear in this silent chamber of darkness. He listened very carefully, trying not to let the hallucinated ringing, the reverberating sounds of his footsteps, his heartbeat, or even the faint sound of fluids moving throughout his body drown out the noise. The sound suddenly caught his eardrums, although faint. He attempted to pursue it, listening very carefully as he approached.</p> <p>The sound started to get closer and louder, and his adrenaline started rushing throughout his body as the possibility of escape finally seemed imminent. As he got closer and closer, a general sense of dread rushed over him, causing him to start breathing a little heavier. He assumed this was the ambience of the level messing with his head again, so he took some deep breaths and another sip of almond water. The feeling didn’t go away, causing him to start freaking out a little.</p> <p>Suddenly, a loud screech pierced his ears. He covered his ears in pain, as going hours in mostly silence caused the loud noise to feel much more painful than it would in normal circumstances. The echoes of the scream vibrated along the hard, metal walls, fully drowning out the faint sound of electricity. His heart dropped into his stomach as he processed what he just heard.</p> <p><em>That sounded like Macy…</em> he thought. <em>No… Alex said it’s impossible to encounter another human in this place. It’s just another hallucination.</em> Another shrill screech echoed through the metal halls, this time far closer than the previous. Max’s heart began pounding like an engine at this point as he froze in fear. He began hyperventilating and sweating profusely.</p> <p>“Max! Max! Help us!” the voice yelled. It undeniably sounded like Macy at this point. He grabbed his bottle of almond water quickly unscrewed the cap, his hands shaking in fear. He began to chug what was left of the water, trying to regain his composure.</p> <p>“MAX! HELP US!” screamed two voices this time. It sounded like both Macy and Alex in unison. Max stumbled backwards the surprise. His ears began to rang as his heart pounded like it was trying to break free from his chest.</p> <p>“It’s not real… it’s not real… it’s not real!” he mumbled. “I’m sorry!” Max turned away from the voice and ran away. He heard the booms of large footsteps following him as he ran for his life. The two voices repeated, slowly growing more distorted as he ran. He screamed in pain as he ran full force into a metal wall, falling backwards as his momentum brought him to a screeching halt. His adrenaline prevented him from faltering, however, and he jumped back up and kept running. He screamed at the top of his lungs in fear for help in a final act of desperation. His legs burned in pain from all of the sprinting he had been doing. The loud footsteps grew closer and closer and closer until suddenly he felt his foot catch on something. He yelled as he felt himself falling, closing his eyes as he prepared to die. He put his arms out to brace for impact wondering if the creature would get him before he even hit the ground. Thumping and thumping and thumping as it got closer, closer, closer…</p> <hr /> <p>Max’s eyelids were suddenly bombarded with a flash of light. He squinted them open in confusion, groaning in pain from all his injuries. He looked up to faintly see a blurry group of people standing over him.</p> <p>“Am I dead? Is this hell?” he muttered with a hoarse voice. The group gasped in shock.</p> <p>“He’s alive? How?” he heard one of them whisper. Max sat up, still struggling to adjust to the bright lights above him after being in pitch black for so long. It was a relief to be able to see again, and a wave of comfort washed over him. He saw one of them reach their hand out to offer him help to stand. He hesitantly accepted the gesture and came to his feet. He rubbed his eyes and finally looked around to assess his new location, realizing he had made it into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">Level 6.1</a>. He turned to look at the group of people surrounding him and gasped in shock. All of them were 7-foot-tall humanoids with TVs for heads. They wore aprons and gloves and had antennas sticking out of the top of their TVs. He stumbled back, not expecting to see such a sight. The creatures themselves also seemed to be a little surprised by his reaction.</p> <p>“Sir, please. You’re covered in bruises and burns! Let us help you!” one of them exclaimed.</p> <p>“You know, I really shouldn’t be surprised at this point. And yet, here we are…” he mumbled under his breath.</p> <p>“Sir, apologies for the sudden disturbance. I can assure you we have nothing but good intentions.” another one said.</p> <p>“Who… what… are you?” he asked defensively.</p> <p>“I believe the M.E.G. refers to us as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-132">Entity 132</a>, but that designation feels a little demeaning, in my opinion; we’ll circle back to that later. We are employees of the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-remodeling-co">Backrooms Remodeling Co</a>. at your service. Please, follow us to the building nearby so that we can be of assistance.” One of them tried to put their arm around his shoulder to help him walk, but Max slapped it away. He yelled in pain as soon as he did this, grabbing his arm and groaning.</p> <p>“Sir, we wish not to harm you. Your body is covered in burns, you have multiple broken bones, several bruises, and you’re in shock. You’ve been through a lot, and we want to help heal you,” another one pleaded.</p> <p>“How do I know I can trust you?” Max asked hesitantly. The TV head whom he had slapped slowly reached his hand out and placed it over one of Max’s burns on his arm. He covered it up for a moment, and then lifted it up. Max was shocked to see that the burn had disappeared, along with the pain in that specific area.</p> <p>“We can help you. Please, sir, I implore you to come with us. You do not have the bandwidth to wander around by yourself.” At this point, Max finally let his guard down and began to breathe normally. The shock of everything he had just endured suddenly overwhelmed him, and he felt his eyelids growing heavy as he fell asleep.</p> <hr /> <p>Max woke up once again to a warm sensation throughout his whole body. The pain that he had been dealing with since the explosion in the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1">casino</a> was notably absent. He opened his eyes to realize he was sitting in a large bath of warm water in the middle of an empty restaurant. He looked around in confusion wondering how he had gotten into this situation. He looked around wondering what happened to his backpack and clothes, only to see them folded neatly on the floor next to him.</p> <p>“Hello? TV guys? Are you there?” he yelled out. He saw one of them peak their head inside the entrance of the restaurant and beckon for the rest to come in.</p> <p>The strange beings wandered in single file and surrounded the tub. He awkwardly squirmed around in the water and covered his exposed self. Now that he had come to his senses, Max was able to finally get a good look at them. They were certainly very interesting beings.</p> <p>All in all, there were four of them. They towered over Max, despite the fact he himself was fairly tall himself. They all wore fancy clothes with gloves and an apron. One wore a blue plaid shirt with a black tie and khaki pants. A name tag saying “Frank” was present next to the tie — presumably his name. The next was Melanie, who wore a pink blouse and jeans. The third was Brittany, who wore a black, long-sleeved polo shirt and black cargo pants with dress shoes. The final was Ralph, who was the shortest of the four, yet still far taller than Max. He wore a purple, short-sleeved polo with khakis and slacks. Max was still in awe over their uncanny appearance: so human, yet so foreign.</p> <p>“Ah, you’re awake.” Melanie held up a small mirror. “Everything feeling alright? Is the water of appropriate rejuvenating temperature? All your ducks in a row, and such?” Max looked at his face in the mirror in awe. Every pimple, blackhead, and acne scar had disappeared. His skin looked like it had a social media beauty filter applied to it in real life. He looked down at the rest of his body, realizing the scars, stretch marks, burns, bruises, and other injuries and impurities had disappeared. He used his tongue to feel the back of his mouth, and was shocked to find even his wisdom teeth had appeared back in his mouth, perfectly aligned in his mouth without causing damage to his other teeth. Despite being removed in high school for being indented, they felt as if they had been there all along.</p> <p>“My… body… how in the world did you-” Max stammered</p> <p>“Apologies, I don’t believe we formally introduced ourselves. As mentioned, the M.E.G. has designated us as Entity 132. We work for the Backrooms Remodeling Company and have been sent to assist with the situation in The Snackrooms, or 6.1 as you refer to it,” Frank explained.</p> <p>“Our job is to fix things that are flawed and make them better. Typically, we section off parts of a level to improve it and fix its impurities, along with generally improving it overall. Levels are usually all we deal with, but we can do the same with humans as well,” Melanie continued.</p> <p>“You were very badly injured when you fell through the roof in front of us. We thought everyone had been evacuated to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">The City</a> by now, and were surprised to find a straggler. Where did you even come from?” Brittany asked.</p> <p>Max’s heart dropped when he realized The M.E.G. had completely vacated the level. Level 6.1 was one of the only safe havens in the Backrooms, but unlike Level 11, this place was not protected by the 11 effect. As a result, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-67">Partygoers</a> noticed this vulnerability and have been attempting to invade the level for many years. Armed guards were stationed around the clock to ensure this nightmare scenario never occurred, as it was considered one of the worst possible case scenarios that the group could endure. He tried to forget about this, hoping The Decay would deter them.</p> <p>“I was stuck in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Level 5</a>, and the only way out was into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6">Level 6</a> through the boiler room. The plan was to get here through that level,” Max responded. The group gasped and looked at each other.</p> <p>“Level 6? Lights out? My word, you went through Lights Out with nothing but a backpack and survived? You are fortunate. Almost everyone who goes in there loses their mind from the vivid hallucinations. No wonder you were in such bad shape…” Ralph murmured.</p> <p>“You were on the verge of death, sir. You’re lucky you landed next to us like you did, or else you may have perished!” Brittany exclaimed.</p> <p>“Fixing humans is always fun. We tried our best not to go too crazy and fix <em>everything</em> like your belly button and your circumcision,” Melanie said. Max blushed with extreme embarrassment, awkwardly looking at the group with immense discomfort.</p> <p>“Mel! What did we talk about? Humans hate it when you tell them about their anatomy. Get your ducks in a row and work on your professionalism! The higher-ups would not be pleased!” Ralph exclaimed, slightly whacking Melanie on the shoulder. Max stared at the odd group with profound confusion.</p> <p>“Ok, I’m sorry. Thank you for helping me, but I need to go find my friends. Have you seen a talking blue bird, a tall white lady with a pony tail, a slightly chubby black lady in a blue robe, a nasty looking lady with super long, greasy hair, or a crusty old man in a ridiculous bird costume running around here, by chance? We all got separated when we entered Level 6, and I need to make sure they’re okay!” Max pleaded.</p> <p>“Apologies, sir. We have not seen anyone other than you since the evacuation. However, The Snackrooms are quite immense. It is possible some of them may be wandering around here,” Brittany explained. Max sighed, still unsure if the voices he was hearing in Level 6 were real or not.</p> <p>“Wait, wait, wait. Evacuation? What are you talking about?” Max asked. The group was silent for a moment.</p> <p>“The higher-ups ordered us to come here and evacuate the residents due to a sudden presence of a troublesome black void that is slowly progressing through levels and consuming everything in its path without prejudice. The M.E.G. has designated it as The Decay. They knew we were the best candidates to stop it due to our synergy, and the remaining M.E.G. agents throughout the level evacuated all the residents while we set up Reality Fresheners, or <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-32">Object 32</a> as you call them, in front of where The Decay currently is. As suspected, it seems to have stopped it in its path, but we need to figure out now how to reverse the damage it has done. We’re kind of boiling the ocean right now with trying to figure this out, and we’re kind of lacking the bandwidth to effectively dive into this, but it’s the best the company can offer at this time,” Ralph responded. All of the heavily forced corporate jargon from these weirdos was starting to give Max a headache.</p> <p>“Goodness… I was trying to get back to Level 11 to inform the Oversight Council about the decay, but it’s progressed way faster than I expected. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a> is probably fully consumed by now at this rate. I wanna see it. I have some research data that may help you out!” Max responded. “Just… um. Do you have a towel?” Frank scurried over to a nearby closet and handed Max a towel as he stood up from the tub, dripping wet. He covered himself awkwardly, still embarrassed to be fully exposed in front of 4 total strangers. He dried himself off and redressed himself quickly, gathering his belongings into his backpack and pockets once again. He was unsettled by the expressionless, black screens that these creatures had for heads. They at least <em>seemed</em> nice, but he was far from trusting them. Once he was ready, he followed the group out of the restaurant and down the long hallway of restaurants.</p> <p>A sense of dread washed over him as he walked down the empty hallway. He had never seen this level so abandoned before. Usually, it was bustling with activity, trading, settlers, and M.E.G. operatives yelling at unruly people. He wasn’t sure if it was the dampness in his hair or the dread, but a chill crawled up his back as he saw this horrifying sight. The threat of an invasion also remained in the back of his mind, giving him some anxiety. The TV heads stopped as they reached a corner and turned around, looking at Max. Due to the absence of facial features, Max had a difficult time reading what they were thinking.</p> <p>“Around this corner is where The Decay has stopped. We’ve been heavily monitoring it since we arrived, and our state of the art Reality Refereshers are working wonderfully! It hasn’t moved an inch since then!” Brittany explained excitedly. Max covered his nose as he was bombarded by the overwhelming scent of mangoes. He took a deep breath as he stared into the cold, dark void before him. The objects, which were plugged into the wall, sprayed a thick blue mist around the entire area which created a haze. Still, the unforgiving darkness of The Decay pierced his pupils like knives.</p> <p>“This is it alright. The unstoppable force that killed my friends…” Max said solemnly as the visions of the explosion flooded his mind.</p> <p>“You said you were able to stop it, correct? What did you discover?” Frank asked.</p> <p>“Well… we threw various different objects at it in an attempt to discover a way to stop it. We thought that <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4">Object 4</a> worked, but when we tried to use it in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1">Level 5.1</a>, it was a dismal failure. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-47">Object 47</a>, however, specifically the black variant, has proven temporarily effective twice. If only you could somehow create a permanent source of black bottled lightning, that could potentially work…” Max replied.</p> <p>“Yes, Deculidators and Black Lightning. The former has quite similar, though inferior, properties to our Reality Fresheners. The latter, however, is quite interesting. Perhaps overwhelming it with unfathomable amounts of energy like Black Bottled Lightning provides is how to stop it…” Mel commented.</p> <p>“Do you have any left?” Ralph asked.</p> <p>“Yes, one left. Sinclair had 3, and gave me 2 for the tests. It’s very rare, and she collected those 3 over years of pilfering <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3">Level 3</a>. We’ve used two, already. Given that Level 3 is probably long gone by now, make it count. This may very well be the last one in existence…” Max said solemnly. He grabbed the bottle from his bag and placed it in Frank’s hand.</p> <p>“Your donation is very appreciated. I will develop a new prototype of a Reality Refresher that will stop The Decay once and for all!” Frank exclaimed excitedly.</p> <p>“Be careful — and whatever you do, do not open it. We’ll all die immediately if you do. It’s one of the most powerful objects in The Backrooms. Put it to good use,” Max ordered sternly.</p> <p>“Worry not. We’re plenty familiar with this. It’s so powerful that opening the bottle will not be necessary. Just the residual static electricity is enough to channel for what we have in mind,” Mel replied confidently.</p> <p>“How long will this take you?” Max asked.</p> <p>“A few hours. Once The Snackrooms are secure, we can then attempt to meet with The Oversight Council to discuss our success with them, and work on securing The City as well. The Backrooms Remodeling Co can develop a partnership with The M.E.G. to ensure humanity’s survival, and everything will be okay,” Brittany asserted confidently.</p> <p>“Well, I’m glad you’re confident. Someone on 11 <em>has</em> to have some lying around somewhere. And if not, at least 6.1 will be safe…” Max sighed.</p> <p>“Right then. Feel free to be on your way to The City, and we will follow you to Base Beta at our earliest convenience. Thank you for working with the Backrooms Remodeling Company!” Frank replied, suddenly reverting to his corporate accent he had when they first met. Max smiled awkwardly and nodded in gratitude.</p> <hr /> <p>Max walked back into the restaurant containing the tub and started packing his things into his sack. Frank walked in, tinkering with the reality refresher in his hands, looking up at Max as he approached.</p> <p>“Are all of your ducks in a row, then? Just wanted to check on you!” Frank said with a painfully forced corporate tone. All of the forced professional jargon was giving him flashbacks to his college internship in an office.</p> <p>“Uh, yeah. I’m just packing my stuff. Thank you again for, uh… fixing me, I suppose,” Max replied shallowly. Frank sat in a nearby chair next to Max, still tinkering with the device.</p> <p>“Can I just ask, if it’s alright, what led you to join The M.E.G. as fodder?” Frank asked. Max was taken aback by the blunt question.</p> <p>“Similar reason as most other people, honestly. I survived Level 0 by the skin of my teeth, and when I made it into Level 1, The M.E.G. was there to save me. During my time there, they presented me with a choice: live quietly on Level 11 like normal, begging for scraps in 6.1… or join their cause and get guaranteed housing, food, pay, and the such. Back on Earth, I was a police officer. I suppose I’ve always had the propensity for risking my life for the greater good.”</p> <p>Frank nodded longingly. It was hard to tell his emotion from the fact he didn’t have a face, but his body language was noticeably sad. “Admittedly, I’ve always disliked The M.E.G. It’s not because I’m hateful or rooting for your downfall, but I’m jealous…” Frank mumbled, ceasing the forced corporate jargon.</p> <p>“How so?” Max asked inquisitively.</p> <p>“When I… <em>we</em> were created, we are born knowing exactly what we are meant to do and our life’s purpose. We are what we are made to be, and that is it. This suit, this tie, these machines — all of it is what I am. If that’s the case, if it’s what I’m supposed to be, I sometimes wonder why I want to be something else so badly. When you came here, you were granted the opportunity to choose your path and decide what you wanted to be. I, on the other hand, do not…” Frank replied solemnly. Max was quiet, feeling sympathetic for him.</p> <p>“What stops you from just abandoning it all?” Max asked.</p> <p>“My loyalty is to the higher-ups. They are my creator. They are everything to me. It is my duty to serve them, and their will is superior to mine. Even though I want to be free, I also want to be loyal to the one who made me. If they want me to be this, then that is what I am, but that doesn’t stop me from wishing I could have both…”</p> <p>“You’re saying you want to join The M.E.G.?”</p> <p>“Something else… As servants to the higher-ups, we are told we are not allowed to choose for ourselves what we want to be. As a result, love is forbidden, as they believe it is disgusting and dangerous. Understanding this, I’ve tried so hard to resist, but… every time I see Mel, I can’t help but look at her. She’s so beautiful, and I want to be with her, but I’m not even supposed to feel this way. If it’s not allowed, why am I hardwired this way? Why are feelings I can’t control wrong?” Frank asked. His screen began to fade into static, surprising Max.</p> <p>“You don’t have to put yourself through this. I can take you to 11 with me. You can be free from these higher-ups and live there. You can be whoever and whatever you want.”</p> <p>“No… As I said, my loyalty is to the higher-ups. They are my creators, and I want to serve them. If serving them means depriving myself of these feelings, I am happy to suffer in their name. They always say they give their most difficult projects to their strongest employees,” Frank replied assertively. White noise began to come loudly out of his TV as Frank’s hand curled into a fist. The other one, which held the Reality Refresher, began to shake. Max was silent for a moment, processing what he said.</p> <p>“How could love be evil? Why is what I am an abomination? Why was I made like this?” Frank asked, his voice stammering and breaking as the volume of the white noise grew progressively louder. “I didn’t choose to be like this… Why am I a monster simply for how I feel? I- I just… I’d rather be free.” Max looked at him with fervent empathy and began to feel incredibly sorry for him. Faintly, Max almost thought he could hear the sound of crying underneath the white noise. Before he could respond, the white noise suddenly stopped, and Frank twitched back into a firm stance. He stood up and turned to Max.</p> <p>“I apologize, it seems I went defective for a moment there. Melanie, Ralph, and Brittany would like to wish you safe travels.” Frank quickly walked out of the restaurant and turned the corner towards the others. Max stared at the wall solemnly in silence. Until now, he was disturbed by the strange personalities of the TV Heads, but now he felt horrible for Frank. He grabbed his bag and followed Frank to the others. He turned the corner to see them all working hard on reprogramming the Reality Refreshers to make full use of the Bottled Lightning. He wanted to say something, but was afraid of making Frank upset.</p> <p>“Ah yes, Max! Are you all prepared to leave?” Brittany asked.</p> <p>“Yeah, thank you guys again for helping me and humanity. I’ll talk to the Base Leader in Level 11 to start returning people to the level. I’ll also let them know of y’all’s good deeds and ensure you are both helped and rewarded adequately.”</p> <p>“Great to hear. The exit to The City is about a 3-minute walk down the corridor,” Melanie replied, pointing in the direction of the exit.</p> <p>“If you get lost and need directions, let us know!” Ralph replied.</p> <p>“Safe travels!” all four of them replied in unison, freaking Max out. He waved with an awkward smile and waved. Before he could even turn around to head towards Level 11, Max heard the loud sound of a bird squawk echo through the long hall of 6.1. He quickly turned around to see <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-7">Jerry</a> flying around the corner and landing on Max’s shoulder. He had a worried expression on his face, breathing heavily.</p> <p>“Jerry! What’s going on? Where are the others?” Max asked with concern.</p> <p>“You stupid Meggies have always been so incompetent!” he squawked with resentment. “Where are all the guards you people have stationed here?!”</p> <p>“They evacuated to 11 because of this!” Max exclaimed, pointing at The Decay. “What’s happening?”</p> <p>“Good going. Because of you idiotic clowns not doing your job, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-67">The Partygoers</a> have taken the opportunity to invade The Snackrooms. About ten of them have emerged to scope the scene, and they’re heading this way. If we hurry, we can escape before they block the exit!” Max’s heart dropped. He had never seen a partygoer before, but he was more than familiar with what they were capable of. One touch, and he was as good as dead. This nightmare, the worst possible case scenario in regards to human safety, had just come true. Max froze as his mind rushed through all the implications and effects of what this meant moving forward… if and when The Decay was ever stopped.</p> <p>“We have to get out of here now. This level is no longer salvageable!” Max screamed.</p> <p>“Do you still doubt our abilities? We can finish this device very quickly, and all of our products wor-”</p> <p>“CAN IT!” Max screamed, interrupting Melanie. “Entity 67 is not something I’m messing with. This is one of the primary scenarios that The M.E.G. was trying to avoid! We’d need an entire army to stop them!” Max started running back down the hallway, hoping to beat the partygoers to the door to Level 11. As soon as he turned the corner, he was greeted by the sight of 3 partygoers rapidly approaching him. Their legs shuffled against each other as they moved, extending their arms outward to show the teeth at the end of their stubs. Small holes were indented into their heads resembling a horrifying smiley face, with red stains around them resembling blood. Whether it was human or not was impossible to tell. Max’s heart began pounding out of his chest at the mere sight of them.</p> <p>“What are you waiting for? Do something!” Jerry exclaimed. Without any further hesitation, Max swung his backpack around his shoulder. He reached in and grabbed a large chunk of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-15">Firesalt</a> and clutched it in his hand. He hurled it towards the floor in front of the monsters and braced himself as it immediately burst into a small explosion. He breathed a sigh of relief as he realized the explosion took all 3 of them out, reducing them to a singed pile of guts.</p> <p>“We have to get out of here n-”</p> <p>“On your right!” Jerry exclaimed again, interrupting Max. Max looked to the right to see another Partygoer peeking out through a window, pointing a crossbow at his head. Max moved his head to the side as the creature shot the bolt, ruffling his hair as it passed mere centimeters above the top of his ear. He turned back towards the TV heads as the arrow flew past him and right towards Frank’s head.</p> <p>Before Max could even say anything, the crossbow bolt pierced the screen of Frank’s head. The glass that made up the screen of his TV shattered immediately, causing Frank to fly backwards from the impact. Max covered his mouth in shock as Frank’s body went limp and flew back into The Decay from the impact of the arrow, falling into the void and disappearing. A tear dropped as he watched the being fly backwards into the abyss. He would never be able to confess his love to Melanie, live a life of choice and freedom, or be free of his prison of morality. Time seemingly froze as the bottle he held flew from his hands and fell towards the floor. Max dove like a soccer goalie around the corner of the wall before the bottle broke, fully aware of what was about to occur. As his body slammed onto the floor, the sound of the small bottle hitting the floor pierced his eardrum like a knife as he prepared for what was about to happen.</p> <p>The bottle shattered on impact, releasing the powerful lightning instantly. The lightning scattered around the entire area, electrocuting Melanie, Brittany, and Ralph. The Reality Refreshers that were plugged into nearby outlets also burst apart from the power of the lightning, causing the blue liquid contained inside to pour out onto the floor. The power from the blast likewise knocked the other three TV heads into the decay, killing them immediately. The lightning bounced around the room, also electrocuting and immediately killing the archer partygoer. Max used the rush from adrenaline to react quickly and run into a nearby restaurant before the residual electricity reached him. He slid onto the ground into the fetal position, crying and hyperventilating.</p> <p>Jerry flew above him, carefully scouting the scene as Max shielded himself on the floor. He flew around the corner with care to avoid the residual sparks to see that the TV heads had all been killed immediately. Perhaps more shocking was the Reality Refreshers and the Bottled Lightning being destroyed. It was incredibly unlikely there were any more of either of those objects left lying around. Even if there were any left, the only ones who knew how to utilize them for their intended goal were gone. The thought was harrowing as Jerry realized that one way or another, humanity would never be able to safely enter Level 6.1 ever again. His thoughts were interrupted by a shriek from Max around the corner. He flew back around to see a group of 5 partygoers entering the room Max was now trapped in.</p> <p>Max grabbed a set of shurikens from his bag and threw them at one of the partygoers, lodging them in its head. To Max’s shock, the creature hardly flinched and kept approaching Max with the others. He grabbed his taser stick that was attached to his waist and extended it, yelling as he whacked the foremost one as hard as he could. The volts of electricity jumped around its body and caused it to collapse. The other four stopped for a moment to look at it, but did not falter. Max ran to the back of the restaurant, clutching the corner of the wall. Max frantically tried throwing more shurikens at the wretched creatures, but they were useless. In a last ditch effort, he took what was left of his Almond Water and splashed it on the creatures, hoping it would have a similar effect as it had on Jerry. Unsurprisingly, this was a failure.</p> <p>“Jerry!” Max screamed. “Tell the others I’m sorry! Tell them I tried to save everyone! Tell Alex I-”</p> <p>Before Max could finish, a comically large sword suddenly appeared behind the hoard and sliced the remaining 4 creatures in half. The upper halves slightly flew up into the air as the bottom halves fell limp. Max looked up to see Father Bluebird coldly staring down at the corpses. His piercing gaze shot out from the darkness caused by his hood and mask, still giving Max a slight chill. He was relieved to see him, however.</p> <p>“Father Bluebird! You’re alive!” Jerry squawked.</p> <p>“I apologize for the delay, your greatness. Level 6 posed quite a challenge, even for someone with the mental fortitude as I.” Max almost snickered at the irony of this statement, briefly forgetting the deadly situation he was in. “It seems The Partygoers have infiltrated this level. We must evacuate to The City immediately.”</p> <p>As he spoke with Jerry, Max noticed the partygoer he had hit earlier start to get up and approach Father Bluebird.</p> <p>“Watch out!” he exclaimed. As Father Bluebird turned around, he didn’t have time to even begin to react to the creature’s approach before a small firesalt explosion killed it instantly, launching the corpse forward towards Father Bluebird. He groaned in disgust.</p> <p>“What was that you wanted to tell me?” a familiar voice asked. Max smiled to see Alex and Sinclair standing side by side in the threshold of the restaurant. Max beamed in relief knowing that they were all okay.</p> <p>“You guys! You’re-”</p> <p>“Save the gushy stuff for later. We got a popsicle stand to blow,” Alex interrupted. Without hesitation, the group charged down the hallway in the direction of the nearest sliding glass door. A group of about 15 more partygoers swarmed the area, entering from an hole that had been blasted through the wall; Max was shocked to see the others charging right into the crowd without hesitation. Father Bluebird effortlessly sliced through them like butter, impaling them with impeccably precise and speedy blows. Max was still awestruck by his agility in spite of his age. Sinclair employed her usual arsenal of offensive objects, hurling an array of miscellaneous weapons into the crowd to take out some of the ones deeper into the crowd. Alex assisted Father Bluebird with her taser stick to ensure he didn’t get overwhelmed and watch his six. Jerry soared above the crowd to see Macy standing at the glass door they intended to reach, using a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-19">Squirt Gun</a> to man off the monsters trying to transform her. Macy saw Jerry in the air and realized the crowd was close, yelling for them to follow her voice.</p> <p>“We’re almost there! Keep going!” Jerry squawked. Sinclair grabbed a glass bottle of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-44">Cashew Water</a> from her pouch and hurled it forward upwards, causing it to shatter on the ceiling. The contents of the glass bottle poured into the group of remaining partygoers, immediately causing several of them to fall to the ground limp. This revealed that the door was now right in front of them. Father Bluebird took one last big swing with his sword to slice any remaining creatures that did not get impacted by the Cashew Water, creating a physical opening. Without hesitation, Alex, Max, and Father Bluebird dove into the glass door and disappeared into the white light that emitted from it. Jerry quickly swooped in from the air. Sinclair stepped over the corpses and paralyzed partygoers and turned around, her back to the door. She turned around to the hole in the wall to see an unfathomably large swarm of partygoers coming through the hole en masse.</p> <p>“Go in, Macy. I’m not letting these sick beasts live get away scot free,” Sinclair snarled. Macy obliged immediately. Sinclair reached into her pouch to pull out a small grenade filled with <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-20">Rixa Gas</a>. Sinclair pulled the pin, hurled it into the group of partygoers in front of her, aiming for the hole. She immediately fell backwards into the door, slamming it shut behind her. As she felt her body noclipping through reality, she saw the gas quickly spread throughout the crowd, narrowly avoiding inhaling it herself.</p> <hr /> <p>Max felt his body slam onto hot, black pavement, groaning in pain. He pushed himself up, looking around to see his friends in the same position. He looked behind him to see one of the restaurants used to enter 6.1 behind him, realizing he had successfully entered Level 11. He looked in front of him to see a skinny woman with purple hair looking down at him. She had a cold expression on her face, and her suit implied she meant business. Max looked up in confusion at the woman.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, did we fall onto you? We were just trying to get out of 6.1, and-”</p> <p>“Did you not listen to the evacuation orders that were provided to you?” she responded coldly.</p> <p>“Long story actually. I-”</p> <p>“Save it. You’re Max Blackfield, correct?” the woman interrupted again. Max sighed in annoyance.</p> <p>“Yes. And who are you supposed to be?”</p> <p>“Overseer B,” she boomed back coldly. Max’s heart dropped. “Quite bold of you to show your face here after your little stunt.”</p> <p>“I’m sorry, what?!” Max exclaimed in disbelief. Overseer B took a small flask of Almond Water from her pocket and unscrewed the cap. Without hesitation, she splashed the contents on Jerry, causing him to fall to the floor and scream in agony like before.</p> <p>“You are under arrest for conspiring with the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/followers-of-jerry">Followers of Jerry</a> to cause widespread destruction across several different levels. You’re going to pay for the grievous crimes you’ve committed against humankind.”</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="font: 1.5rem 'Mate SC'"> <p><strong>The Broken City will continue in Chapter 6</strong></p> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/terror">Terror</a> | <strong>Good Intentions</strong> | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/caged-birds">Caged Birds</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713000" alt="Natedagreat563" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" >Natedagreat563</a></span></p>

				<title>Level 6.31 - &quot;Pierce the Veil&quot;</title>

				<description>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com//interwiki.backroomswiki.cn/styleFrame.html?priority=2&amp;type=sidebar&amp;override=0&amp;theme=https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com//local--code/theme%3Adecay/1&amp;css={$css}&quot; style=&quot;display: none&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;darkblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thought pervaded my mind as I traipsed through the abyss: &amp;quot;Am I dead?&amp;quot; I had wandered the &lt;tt&gt;vantablack&lt;/tt&gt; halls of the level for long enough &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; I had simply accepted the fact that there was no going back and that my only fate would be succumbing to the decay. The walls ceased to exist, and when I tried to wander back from whence I came, there was nothing to be found. Is this how it felt to be swallowed? To become nothing? Well, that could not be; I still felt myself, and I was still real, and as long as I was real, I could carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inscrutable amount of time went by. All I had were my thoughts and myself, as even the floor seemed to turn into nothing after some time. I was walking on air, through nothing incarnate. My body was all that I could discern within this darkness, being the only way for me to tell that I was still alive. I could hear the blood pumping through my ears, my organs churning and squelching, and my joints and muscles crunching and clenching with each step I took. I tasted the aridity of my mouth and sinuses &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; a vivid metallic, rusty flavour flooding shrivelled tastebuds once my skin started to flake &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; and my nose started to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what must have been days, maybe weeks, of wandering in a daze, I was snapped out of my trance by the trickle and splash of running water. I certainly could not see it &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; that would be a miracle &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; but I could hear it very close. I desperately stumbled my way over to the source of the sound, my leg muscles stiff and tight, ligaments prepared to snap, and joints popping with every little move. I took one more step closer, then felt a sensation run up my spine and through my entire nervous system, flooding me with shock. Tears weakly poured out of my withered tear ducts. I had stepped into a frigid, shallow puddle, which sent my isolated senses into a panic. I quickly stepped back, took a moment to collect myself, and then stepped forward once more, even closer to the source. It had gradually made its way from the sound of a lazy river to an unforgiving waterfall, and I could feel the water getting deeper, spraying at me as I approached. I allowed the water to soak me fully, kneeling down and cupping mouthfuls of it just next to the source where it was freshest. It tasted vaguely of almonds. I basked in the sensation &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; who cared if it was freezing cold &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; and came to realize that both the hoodie and sweatpants that I had never noticed I was wearing before were absolutely drenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood up after some time, hydrated and having earned my second wind, and decided to push through this stream. It was the only promising path onward, and so I endured the brutal beatings of the fluid as it pelted my back for a few seconds. Just then, I realized that the floor was dry here; however, there was a floor. It was smooth and slippery to my moist feet, and I became dizzy, and&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:700%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;trending_down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell forward, but the ground was not what caught me. I fell at least 30 feet over a ledge onto a fabric of sorts, thick and durable enough to hold my weight, albeit with quite a bit of give. The fabric seemed to curve upward, which worried me since I would not be able to climb it with how smooth it was, how far I sunk into it despite my starved frame, even though I was soaking wet. And so I clawed; I clawed and clawed away, punching, kicking, jumping, biting &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; anything I could think of to &lt;tt&gt;pierce&lt;/tt&gt; through this unreasonably durable cloth. I huffed and puffed, and as I took a short rest, I came up with an idea. I began to bite off one of my toenails as sharply as I could, plunging it into the fabric as if it were a mighty blade. And then there was light. Even if just a miniscule beam of it, there was light. My eyes sizzled as they adjusted to the foreign sensation, but I wouldn&#039;t allow them to take their time. I desperately shoved on the opening, sticking a finger, then a few, then a hand, then my whole body through, out into the &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px, 2px 2px 2px;color:#ffffff;&quot;&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.31&lt;/strong&gt; is a sprawling series of white&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;painted&amp;nbsp;corridors made of smooth, solid limestone. The sub-section&#039;s decay&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;resistant resources and properties make it a sought&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;out destination for people from all walks of life in the Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sub-section itself is entirely enclosed, though the further that one wanders, the more open it becomes. A majority of the sub-section&#039;s population resides within a few kilometres of its entrance, hunkering down in rooms once the hallways turn into rooms turn into concourses. The further you travel, the more common it becomes to encounter oddities in the otherwise sensible architecture of the sub-section ; haphazard sets of stairs that lead nowhere, sudden dead&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;ends, and other wholly illogical additions can be found frequently at about ten kilometres out, which is the farthest distance that anyone has travelled before returning to base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.31&lt;/strong&gt; is completely devoid of any artificial or natural lighting, illuminated only by the native substance that coats its every nook and cranny, given the name &amp;quot;vantawhite&amp;quot;. Juxtaposed to vantablack, vantawhite emits its own subtle glow, mitigating the need for any other light sources in the first place. Vantawhite serves the alternative purpose of resisting the decay by acting as an opposing force that prevents it from spreading to any surface that is coated with it. The substance is secreted incrementally from every stationary surface of the sub-section, including those brought in from the outside, possessing the texture of wet paint but drying much faster, making it quite difficult to efficiently harvest in large quantities. Another notable feature of vantawhite is its strict neutrality when it comes to interfering with anything other than decay, having no discernible effect on crops, chemicals, or objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bases and Communities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.31&lt;/strong&gt; is home to a community of over three hundred people, with bases set up within a three&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;kilometre radius of the entry point. Appliances and beds are rather scarce, which is to be expected given how troublesome it is to reach the sub-section. Greenhouses have been assembled with whatever materials are available and are off&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;limits to untrusted individuals because of how crucial they are to survival on the sub-section. The entirety of the food supply rests in the hands of the botanists who manage these greenhouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community itself is quite welcoming, accepting wanderers from all factions due to the dire situation of the decay. Run&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;ins with the Sons of Decay, however, have left some weary of newer folks, understandably so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entry and Egress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to enter &lt;strong&gt;Level 6.31&lt;/strong&gt; is by wandering too far into &lt;tt&gt;vantablack&lt;/tt&gt;. After some time, it will feel as though the floor has disappeared. You&#039;ll eventually hear trickling water, which is the only indicator of the entrance. It comes from a waterfall that you should walk through. Past the waterfall there will be an abrupt drop onto a thick fabric material. In order to enter the sub-section, you have to &lt;tt&gt;pierce the veil&lt;/tt&gt;. It is not recommended to attempt entry to this sub-section unprepared, for the process can take up to weeks, all of which would be spent in almost complete sensory deprivation. It also comes with the risk of being consumed by the decay prevalent in Level 6.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exiting the sub-section has yet to be attempted. The threat that the decay and distance pose leaves too many uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dark-styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I squinted apart the eyelids that I forgot I had, only to be met by a skull&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;piercing migraine. I emerged from the cloth and stepped a short distance down onto a blinding white, glowing floor, pulling the curtain over my head and discarding it behind me. I peered at the path ahead of me: a set of white arches. I crept forward as I slowly opened my eyes, the burn growing more bearable as time flowed. My bare, moist feet enjoyed the texture of the smooth floor as I wandered around. I wandered for a few minutes, a left turn here, a right turn there, all too enraptured by the return of my sense of sight to exhibit any caution. In the distance, boots clicked and echoed down the halls. I stopped dead in my tracks. Human interaction&amp;#8230; It was not just in the void that I was deprived of it; I had gone weeks on end without ever speaking, since the decay split me apart from all the people that I had known. I took a breath, then continued pacing towards the clicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He- hello?&amp;quot; I said hesitantly, yet loudly enough for the phrase to echo deep into the chasms of the realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey! Are you new here? Your voice doesn&#039;t sound too familiar!&amp;quot; The man replied even louder than I had been, which made it obvious as to where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite sure that he was human. No entity that would reveal their location like that is capable of fluent speech. I hastily approached the location whence the voice came, almost forgetting to reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh- um, yes, yes I am.&amp;quot; I said in a more hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I met a four-way crossroad, the man turned the corner into the hallway just ahead of me, smiling reassuringly as he caught my gaze. He was a bearded man who adorned himself with a red and black plaid jacket and ripped blue jeans. He resembled the stereotypical lumberjack, with a kind, tight, and wrinkled face, weathered from too much smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello there! Oh, you look pretty thin. The way here must&#039;ve been pretty rough, huh?&amp;quot; the man said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused for a moment to think about how to reply. He took this as an opportunity to continue, &amp;quot;Name&#039;s Tim. Good to meetcha&#039;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, good to meet you too. I&#039;m Earl. I&#039;ve hardly eaten in the past&amp;#8230; weeks? Days? I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m not all too sure.&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, don&#039;t sweat the details bud. Time&#039;s impossible to track in that place. More importantly, let&#039;s get you nice and full.&amp;quot; Tim replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim fished his hand into his pocket, withdrawing a shiny green apple and handing it to me. I accepted it graciously, scarfing it down with more heart than I knew I ever had. It was sour and juicy. If I had not just gone days (?) without food, I would confidently say that it was the best apple I had ever tasted. Tim continued as I chewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, you&#039;re quite lucky to have made it here unscathed. As far as we know, this place is one of a kind when it comes to defending against the decay. The paint on the ground is the secret, y&#039;see. Anyways, there&#039;s a bunch more of us set up in some of the bigger spaces further ahead.&amp;quot; Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded, swallowing the last bits of the apple, save for the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, and I&#039;ll take that off your hands. We&#039;re self&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;sustaining here; wouldn&#039;t want to waste them seeds, heheh!&amp;quot; Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed it to him, and he shoved it back into his pocket, turning his back to me and motioning for me to follow him back from whence he came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk was silent. I definitely was not one for conversation, which might have been the only reason I had kept my bearings during my time in the void, but I had figured that Tim would have at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to talk about. Regardless, we continued walking until the hallways turned into rooms, each separated by doorways of their own, which kept to the original size of the hallways from before. I could hear chatter in the rooms around us, and there were pieces of furniture that decorated rooms more thoroughly the closer we got to the voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, I&#039;m gonna head off to get these seeds planted. If you&#039;re still hungry, you can ask around for the lunchroom. Good luck!&amp;quot; Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you&amp;quot;, I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked off into another room, and I opted to follow the chatter. A few rooms ahead, I could make out some women on white sofas, laughing and shoving on each other. I looked to my right and saw a room where there were two men standing in its centre. The men seemed to be of more importance, so I made my way over. Their conversation paused as they noticed my approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello there, can I help you?&amp;quot; said a man in a smooth grey suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. If possible, could you show me to the lunchroom? I&#039;m new here.&amp;quot; I responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, that makes sense. Sure, I&#039;ll have Clark here show you around&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; actually, Clark, would you mind briefing the young man on your assignment? I&#039;ve been meaning to find someone to tag along, and this lad looks like he&#039;d do just fine,&amp;quot; the man said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure, I don&#039;t see why not.&amp;quot; Clark replied, walking past the doorway toward me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark wore a ragged black suit, visibly worn from various expeditions. A white button&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;up undershirt peeked out from behind his lapel, coupled with a bright red tie. From his appearance, it was quite obvious to me that he is &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; or at least used to be &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; a B.N.T.G. worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And you are?&amp;quot; Clark asked, now just a few steps away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Earl. Now what was it that he said about an assignment? I&#039;m more than willing to help out as long as it fills my stomach.&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, Earl, let&#039;s get you fed before I give you the details. The lunchroom is only a few rooms down; I don&#039;t see why Tim couldn&#039;t have shown you there himself.&amp;quot; Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked past me into the room I was in before, turning right towards the room with the women, then left into a larger room with benches all around, the inviting aroma of stew flooding my deprived nose as I followed behind him. At the opposite end of the room was a row of cheap tables stocked with large pots. We made our way to the tables, which were about thirty paces away, and he waited for me to eat. The pots were mostly empty, since apparently lunch had passed hours ago, but the food was still warm enough. I located a half&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;full pot, scooping out the soup until I was satiated (this was not all too long since I ate with haste). As I set down the ladle, Clark immediately walked past the tables through another doorway. I stumbled behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we off to now?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, we&#039;re headed to the outskirts of the sub-section. As you may have noticed, the rooms here get larger the further we travel, so our task is to see just how large they can get. You may notice some oddities here and there, but those seem to become standard the further you travel.&amp;quot; Clark replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oddities? Such as?&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark sighed. &amp;quot;You&#039;ll know it when you see it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My legs were already so numb from all the walking I had done that I could no longer feel them. Clark had bags under his eyes, his expression never changing. &amp;quot;Is this how they train their workers at the B.N.T.G.?&amp;quot; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After kilometres upon kilometres of travelling, the rooms were collosal. These rooms could house thousands of people at this point, each doorway growing further apart than the last. Upside&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;down staircases that led to nothing and nowhere dotted the ceilings and walls. Platforms, pillars, and segments of wall poked out here and there. &amp;quot;So this was what he meant,&amp;quot; I thought to myself. We pressed on, Clark&#039;s stride never faltering or picking up at any point, much like his voice and demeanour; his step was monotonous. Rooms &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; nay, spaces &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; grew more and more spacious, to the point where it was difficult to see the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Ahem.&lt;/em&gt; Clark, where are we headed, exactly? Is there something we&#039;re looking for here, or&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not in particular, no. Our task is to walk as far as we safely can and return with whatever findings we have.&amp;quot; Clark said sternly, turning back to face me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark turned back to look where he was going, and in shock (I had not thought this possible) widened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-31/trip-balls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trip-balls.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is&amp;#8230; that normal?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not answer. He turned back, but there was no doorway. He saw no walls or ceiling, but only the structure that lay ahead of us. We continued walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been no more than a few hours now since I had entered the sub-section, and these architectural anomalies were everywhere. It seemed as though we had pushed past a threshold that we were not supposed to cross. Thick layers of fog condensed in my mind, my steps became unsteady, and my breath got weaker. My eyelids fluttered and my vision flickered; my legs gave out all at once, and my face was planted firmly onto the stone floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-center&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-31/building.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last frame that my retinas provided me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all faded to black as a sharp, throbbing pain filled my gut. As my lungs closed in on themselves, breathing became a pathetic struggle. I spattered up blood as Clark shoved me over onto my back. Even though I could not see his expression, something told me that he still carried his standard vacant look. My brain pulsated and stung. My heart pounded and gushed out blood from my internal wounds rapidly, coming to a sudden halt after not too long. Despite the soup I devoured beforehand, the taste of bitter almonds remained on the tip of my tongue, along with a hint of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark stood up once he had confirmed I was deceased, staring up at the skyscraper in front of him. He sighed, then began his trek once more, off to complete his assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve been met with unfortunate news. As of a week ago, Clark and a newly arrived young man by the name of Earl have been reported missing. They were tasked with the exploration of the outskirts of the sub-section. Due to the nature of their disappearance, we have elected to steer clear of the sub-section&#039;s deeper chasms. Please do not travel further than our outposts&#039; reach for your own safety. Do not attempt to pierce the veil of ignorance that we have been graced with; ignorance is bliss, after all. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

The walls ceased to exist, and when I tried to wander back from whence I came, there was nothing to be found. Is this how it felt to be swallowed? To become nothing? Well, that could not be; I still felt myself, and I was still real, and as long as I was real, I could carry on.</p> <p>An inscrutable amount of time went by. All I had were my thoughts and myself, as even the floor seemed to turn into nothing after some time. I was walking on air, through nothing incarnate. My body was all that I could discern within this darkness, being the only way for me to tell that I was still alive. I could hear the blood pumping through my ears, my organs churning and squelching, and my joints and muscles crunching and clenching with each step I took. I tasted the aridity of my mouth and sinuses <strong>—</strong> a vivid metallic, rusty flavour flooding shrivelled tastebuds once my skin started to flake <strong>—</strong> and my nose started to bleed.</p> <p>After what must have been days, maybe weeks, of wandering in a daze, I was snapped out of my trance by the trickle and splash of running water. I certainly could not see it <strong>—</strong> that would be a miracle <strong>—</strong> but I could hear it very close. I desperately stumbled my way over to the source of the sound, my leg muscles stiff and tight, ligaments prepared to snap, and joints popping with every little move. I took one more step closer, then felt a sensation run up my spine and through my entire nervous system, flooding me with shock. Tears weakly poured out of my withered tear ducts. I had stepped into a frigid, shallow puddle, which sent my isolated senses into a panic. I quickly stepped back, took a moment to collect myself, and then stepped forward once more, even closer to the source. It had gradually made its way from the sound of a lazy river to an unforgiving waterfall, and I could feel the water getting deeper, spraying at me as I approached. I allowed the water to soak me fully, kneeling down and cupping mouthfuls of it just next to the source where it was freshest. It tasted vaguely of almonds. I basked in the sensation <strong>—</strong> who cared if it was freezing cold <strong>—</strong> and came to realize that both the hoodie and sweatpants that I had never noticed I was wearing before were absolutely drenched.</p> <p>I stood up after some time, hydrated and having earned my second wind, and decided to push through this stream. It was the only promising path onward, and so I endured the brutal beatings of the fluid as it pelted my back for a few seconds. Just then, I realized that the floor was dry here; however, there was a floor. It was smooth and slippery to my moist feet, and I became dizzy, and&#8230;</p> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p><span style="font-size:700%;"><span class="material-icons">trending_down</span></span></p> </div> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <p>I fell forward, but the ground was not what caught me. I fell at least 30 feet over a ledge onto a fabric of sorts, thick and durable enough to hold my weight, albeit with quite a bit of give. The fabric seemed to curve upward, which worried me since I would not be able to climb it with how smooth it was, how far I sunk into it despite my starved frame, even though I was soaking wet. And so I clawed; I clawed and clawed away, punching, kicking, jumping, biting <strong>—</strong> anything I could think of to <tt>pierce</tt> through this unreasonably durable cloth. I huffed and puffed, and as I took a short rest, I came up with an idea. I began to bite off one of my toenails as sharply as I could, plunging it into the fabric as if it were a mighty blade. And then there was light. Even if just a miniscule beam of it, there was light. My eyes sizzled as they adjusted to the foreign sensation, but I wouldn't allow them to take their time. I desperately shoved on the opening, sticking a finger, then a few, then a hand, then my whole body through, out into the <span style="text-shadow:1px 1px 1px, 2px 2px 2px;color:#ffffff;">light</span>.</p> </div> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-31/white.jpg" alt="white.jpg" class="image" /></div> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <div class="meta-title"> <p>Level 6.31 - &quot;Pierce the Veil&quot;</p> </div> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <div class="sd-container"> <div class="top-box class-habitable color-{$color}"> <div class="header-diamond"> <div class="bg"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-color class-habitable color-{$color}"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-pattern"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-image class-habitable {$image}"></div> </div> <div class="gradient-box"> <div class="top-text"> <p>SURVIVAL DIFFICULTY:</p> </div> <div class="bottom-text"> <p>Class habitable</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bottom-box class-habitable"> <ul> <li><span class="{$one}">{$one}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> <li><span class="{$two}">{$two}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> <li><span class="{$three}">{$three}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> <p><strong>Level 6.31</strong> is a sprawling series of white<strong>-</strong>painted&nbsp;corridors made of smooth, solid limestone. The sub-section's decay<strong>-</strong>resistant resources and properties make it a sought<strong>-</strong>out destination for people from all walks of life in the Backrooms.</p> <p>The sub-section itself is entirely enclosed, though the further that one wanders, the more open it becomes. A majority of the sub-section's population resides within a few kilometres of its entrance, hunkering down in rooms once the hallways turn into rooms turn into concourses. The further you travel, the more common it becomes to encounter oddities in the otherwise sensible architecture of the sub-section ; haphazard sets of stairs that lead nowhere, sudden dead<strong>-</strong>ends, and other wholly illogical additions can be found frequently at about ten kilometres out, which is the farthest distance that anyone has travelled before returning to base.</p> <p><strong>Level 6.31</strong> is completely devoid of any artificial or natural lighting, illuminated only by the native substance that coats its every nook and cranny, given the name &quot;vantawhite&quot;. Juxtaposed to vantablack, vantawhite emits its own subtle glow, mitigating the need for any other light sources in the first place. Vantawhite serves the alternative purpose of resisting the decay by acting as an opposing force that prevents it from spreading to any surface that is coated with it. The substance is secreted incrementally from every stationary surface of the sub-section, including those brought in from the outside, possessing the texture of wet paint but drying much faster, making it quite difficult to efficiently harvest in large quantities. Another notable feature of vantawhite is its strict neutrality when it comes to interfering with anything other than decay, having no discernible effect on crops, chemicals, or objects.</p> <h1><span>Bases and Communities</span></h1> <p><strong>Level 6.31</strong> is home to a community of over three hundred people, with bases set up within a three<strong>-</strong>kilometre radius of the entry point. Appliances and beds are rather scarce, which is to be expected given how troublesome it is to reach the sub-section. Greenhouses have been assembled with whatever materials are available and are off<strong>-</strong>limits to untrusted individuals because of how crucial they are to survival on the sub-section. The entirety of the food supply rests in the hands of the botanists who manage these greenhouses.</p> <p>The community itself is quite welcoming, accepting wanderers from all factions due to the dire situation of the decay. Run<strong>-</strong>ins with the Sons of Decay, however, have left some weary of newer folks, understandably so.</p> <h1><span>Entry and Egress</span></h1> <p>The only way to enter <strong>Level 6.31</strong> is by wandering too far into <tt>vantablack</tt>. After some time, it will feel as though the floor has disappeared. You'll eventually hear trickling water, which is the only indicator of the entrance. It comes from a waterfall that you should walk through. Past the waterfall there will be an abrupt drop onto a thick fabric material. In order to enter the sub-section, you have to <tt>pierce the veil</tt>. It is not recommended to attempt entry to this sub-section unprepared, for the process can take up to weeks, all of which would be spent in almost complete sensory deprivation. It also comes with the risk of being consumed by the decay prevalent in Level 6.3.</p> <p>Exiting the sub-section has yet to be attempted. The threat that the decay and distance pose leaves too many uncertainties.</p> <hr /> <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p> <div class="dark-styled-quote"> <p>I squinted apart the eyelids that I forgot I had, only to be met by a skull<strong>-</strong>piercing migraine. I emerged from the cloth and stepped a short distance down onto a blinding white, glowing floor, pulling the curtain over my head and discarding it behind me. I peered at the path ahead of me: a set of white arches. I crept forward as I slowly opened my eyes, the burn growing more bearable as time flowed. My bare, moist feet enjoyed the texture of the smooth floor as I wandered around. I wandered for a few minutes, a left turn here, a right turn there, all too enraptured by the return of my sense of sight to exhibit any caution. In the distance, boots clicked and echoed down the halls. I stopped dead in my tracks. Human interaction&#8230; It was not just in the void that I was deprived of it; I had gone weeks on end without ever speaking, since the decay split me apart from all the people that I had known. I took a breath, then continued pacing towards the clicking.</p> <p>&quot;He- hello?&quot; I said hesitantly, yet loudly enough for the phrase to echo deep into the chasms of the realm.</p> <p>&quot;Hey! Are you new here? Your voice doesn't sound too familiar!&quot; The man replied even louder than I had been, which made it obvious as to where he was.</p> <p>I was quite sure that he was human. No entity that would reveal their location like that is capable of fluent speech. I hastily approached the location whence the voice came, almost forgetting to reply.</p> <p>&quot;Oh- um, yes, yes I am.&quot; I said in a more hushed tone.</p> <p>As I met a four-way crossroad, the man turned the corner into the hallway just ahead of me, smiling reassuringly as he caught my gaze. He was a bearded man who adorned himself with a red and black plaid jacket and ripped blue jeans. He resembled the stereotypical lumberjack, with a kind, tight, and wrinkled face, weathered from too much smiling.</p> <p>&quot;Hello there! Oh, you look pretty thin. The way here must've been pretty rough, huh?&quot; the man said.</p> <p>I paused for a moment to think about how to reply. He took this as an opportunity to continue, &quot;Name's Tim. Good to meetcha'.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yes, good to meet you too. I'm Earl. I've hardly eaten in the past&#8230; weeks? Days? I'm sorry, I'm not all too sure.&quot; I said.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, don't sweat the details bud. Time's impossible to track in that place. More importantly, let's get you nice and full.&quot; Tim replied.</p> <p>Tim fished his hand into his pocket, withdrawing a shiny green apple and handing it to me. I accepted it graciously, scarfing it down with more heart than I knew I ever had. It was sour and juicy. If I had not just gone days (?) without food, I would confidently say that it was the best apple I had ever tasted. Tim continued as I chewed.</p> <p>&quot;Well, you're quite lucky to have made it here unscathed. As far as we know, this place is one of a kind when it comes to defending against the decay. The paint on the ground is the secret, y'see. Anyways, there's a bunch more of us set up in some of the bigger spaces further ahead.&quot; Tim said.</p> <p>I nodded, swallowing the last bits of the apple, save for the core.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, and I'll take that off your hands. We're self<strong>-</strong>sustaining here; wouldn't want to waste them seeds, heheh!&quot; Tim said.</p> <p>I passed it to him, and he shoved it back into his pocket, turning his back to me and motioning for me to follow him back from whence he came.</p> <p>The walk was silent. I definitely was not one for conversation, which might have been the only reason I had kept my bearings during my time in the void, but I had figured that Tim would have at least <em>something</em> to talk about. Regardless, we continued walking until the hallways turned into rooms, each separated by doorways of their own, which kept to the original size of the hallways from before. I could hear chatter in the rooms around us, and there were pieces of furniture that decorated rooms more thoroughly the closer we got to the voices.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, I'm gonna head off to get these seeds planted. If you're still hungry, you can ask around for the lunchroom. Good luck!&quot; Tim said.</p> <p>&quot;Thank you&quot;, I said.</p> <p>He walked off into another room, and I opted to follow the chatter. A few rooms ahead, I could make out some women on white sofas, laughing and shoving on each other. I looked to my right and saw a room where there were two men standing in its centre. The men seemed to be of more importance, so I made my way over. Their conversation paused as they noticed my approach.</p> <p>&quot;Hello there, can I help you?&quot; said a man in a smooth grey suit.</p> <p>&quot;Yes. If possible, could you show me to the lunchroom? I'm new here.&quot; I responded.</p> <p>&quot;Ah, that makes sense. Sure, I'll have Clark here show you around<strong>-</strong> actually, Clark, would you mind briefing the young man on your assignment? I've been meaning to find someone to tag along, and this lad looks like he'd do just fine,&quot; the man said.</p> <p>&quot;Sure, I don't see why not.&quot; Clark replied, walking past the doorway toward me.</p> <p>Clark wore a ragged black suit, visibly worn from various expeditions. A white button<strong>-</strong>up undershirt peeked out from behind his lapel, coupled with a bright red tie. From his appearance, it was quite obvious to me that he is <strong>—</strong> or at least used to be <strong>—</strong> a B.N.T.G. worker.</p> <p>&quot;And you are?&quot; Clark asked, now just a few steps away.</p> <p>&quot;Earl. Now what was it that he said about an assignment? I'm more than willing to help out as long as it fills my stomach.&quot; I said.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, Earl, let's get you fed before I give you the details. The lunchroom is only a few rooms down; I don't see why Tim couldn't have shown you there himself.&quot; Clark said.</p> <p>He walked past me into the room I was in before, turning right towards the room with the women, then left into a larger room with benches all around, the inviting aroma of stew flooding my deprived nose as I followed behind him. At the opposite end of the room was a row of cheap tables stocked with large pots. We made our way to the tables, which were about thirty paces away, and he waited for me to eat. The pots were mostly empty, since apparently lunch had passed hours ago, but the food was still warm enough. I located a half<strong>-</strong>full pot, scooping out the soup until I was satiated (this was not all too long since I ate with haste). As I set down the ladle, Clark immediately walked past the tables through another doorway. I stumbled behind him.</p> <p>&quot;Where are we off to now?&quot; I asked.</p> <p>&quot;Well, we're headed to the outskirts of the sub-section. As you may have noticed, the rooms here get larger the further we travel, so our task is to see just how large they can get. You may notice some oddities here and there, but those seem to become standard the further you travel.&quot; Clark replied.</p> <p>&quot;Oddities? Such as?&quot; I said.</p> <p>Clark sighed. &quot;You'll know it when you see it.&quot;</p> <p>My legs were already so numb from all the walking I had done that I could no longer feel them. Clark had bags under his eyes, his expression never changing. &quot;Is this how they train their workers at the B.N.T.G.?&quot; I thought to myself.</p> <p>After kilometres upon kilometres of travelling, the rooms were collosal. These rooms could house thousands of people at this point, each doorway growing further apart than the last. Upside<strong>-</strong>down staircases that led to nothing and nowhere dotted the ceilings and walls. Platforms, pillars, and segments of wall poked out here and there. &quot;So this was what he meant,&quot; I thought to myself. We pressed on, Clark's stride never faltering or picking up at any point, much like his voice and demeanour; his step was monotonous. Rooms <strong>—</strong> nay, spaces <strong>—</strong> grew more and more spacious, to the point where it was difficult to see the walls.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Ahem.</em> Clark, where are we headed, exactly? Is there something we're looking for here, or<strong>—</strong>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Not in particular, no. Our task is to walk as far as we safely can and return with whatever findings we have.&quot; Clark said sternly, turning back to face me.</p> <p>Clark turned back to look where he was going, and in shock (I had not thought this possible) widened his eyes.</p> <img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-31/trip-balls.jpg" alt="trip-balls.jpg" class="image" /> <p>&quot;Is&#8230; that normal?&quot; I asked.</p> <p>He did not answer. He turned back, but there was no doorway. He saw no walls or ceiling, but only the structure that lay ahead of us. We continued walking.</p> <p>It had been no more than a few hours now since I had entered the sub-section, and these architectural anomalies were everywhere. It seemed as though we had pushed past a threshold that we were not supposed to cross. Thick layers of fog condensed in my mind, my steps became unsteady, and my breath got weaker. My eyelids fluttered and my vision flickered; my legs gave out all at once, and my face was planted firmly onto the stone floor.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-31/building.jpg" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>The last frame that my retinas provided me.</p> </div> </div> <p>It all faded to black as a sharp, throbbing pain filled my gut. As my lungs closed in on themselves, breathing became a pathetic struggle. I spattered up blood as Clark shoved me over onto my back. Even though I could not see his expression, something told me that he still carried his standard vacant look. My brain pulsated and stung. My heart pounded and gushed out blood from my internal wounds rapidly, coming to a sudden halt after not too long. Despite the soup I devoured beforehand, the taste of bitter almonds remained on the tip of my tongue, along with a hint of blood.</p> <p>Clark stood up once he had confirmed I was deceased, staring up at the skyscraper in front of him. He sighed, then began his trek once more, off to complete his assignment.</p> </div> <p><br /> <br /> <br /></p> <div class="styled-quote"> <p>We've been met with unfortunate news. As of a week ago, Clark and a newly arrived young man by the name of Earl have been reported missing. They were tasked with the exploration of the outskirts of the sub-section. Due to the nature of their disappearance, we have elected to steer clear of the sub-section's deeper chasms. Please do not travel further than our outposts' reach for your own safety. Do not attempt to pierce the veil of ignorance that we have been graced with; ignorance is bliss, after all.

&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You walk through the remnants of the laboratory before you, infatuated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Less than a month ago, you&#039;d known this place as the &lt;strong&gt;final frontier&lt;/strong&gt; of anti-decay weapons research. That was until all communications were haphazardly cut. People from your base camp rumored that the &lt;em&gt;decay&lt;/em&gt; had already swallowed them whole; others believed they had found an exit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These rumors are what propagated the mission &amp;quot;Seared Frontier.&amp;quot; You were assigned a simple task: find out what happened here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scrounging around the barren desks, you stumble across a journal on the floor next to some blueprints, labeled &amp;quot;Heartman,&amp;quot; who you knew as both an assistant researcher in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;the M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Immediately flipping to the first page&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;with hopes of finding some sign of what happened&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;you find that the interior remains miraculously largely undamaged. You skim through the page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;June 2nd, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Hey there, journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Today, I&#039;ve been officially assigned to my first station! It&#039;s quite hopeful to see these different kinds of groups coming together to stop this &lt;em&gt;Decay&lt;/em&gt; thing. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-robotics&quot;&gt;Robotics&lt;/a&gt; with their ingenuity,&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-b-n-t-g&quot;&gt;the B.N.T.G.&lt;/a&gt; with their resources, and the M.E.G. with their research. With all of us&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;along with a few others I didn&#039;t mention&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;I feel like we&#039;ve got a good chance of crushing this decay. I haven&#039;t been briefed on what we&#039;re going to be doing just yet to end this, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;m not interested to find out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skimming the journal, a faint smile is painted across your face. Heartman was inexperienced, which showed in the way she conducted herself. No useful information yet; you skim to the next page:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;June 9th, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Hey again, journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;It&#039;s been a while since I last updated this thing, but a lot has happened since I last wrote. For instance, with our current knowledge, we estimate that it should take only a couple of days to syart experimenting on a possible solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;I wonder how long it&#039;ll take to get satisfactory results. After all, we all know what&#039;s at stake if we don&#039;t come up with a solution&amp;#8230; I guess I&#039;m just being a cynic. We&#039;ve got this. Everyone else is counting on us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You furrow your brow. Perhaps the situation was worse than you thought, considering even the always-optimistic Heartman wasn&#039;t too sure. You read on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;June 14th, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Hello, journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;I&#039;ve been putting overtime into this project. As I&#039;m writing this, we have a couple of different inventions being built. Our one completed project&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;which we&#039;re calling the &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;is a compound that utilizes a combination of Backrooms&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;unique materials to kill off the infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;Now, I&#039;ll be honest, I didn&#039;t believe it&#039;d succeed until we tested it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-511&quot;&gt;Level 511&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s destructive phenomenon. When the compound was administered on the phenomenon, it sizzled down to the portion where the infection destroyed its last particle. After this, we weren&#039;t able to detect any signs of the phenomenon. It&#039;s far from confirmation, but at least we know that it&#039;s ready for field testing. I&#039;ll write more on this once it&#039;s done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Update: Holy shit that was a disaster. I&#039;d been hyped up to see the fruits of our labor, only for the compound to dissolve in the &lt;em&gt;decay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you read on, you ask yourself whether you could&#039;ve supported her more. You take your phone and take a picture of the test and the results, moving on to the next page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;June 17th, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Well, journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;A team of 5 people went missing without a trace this morning. Worse yet, they took both our months of research documents and the device that the Backrooms Robotics was spending their time on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;What&#039;s even the point of going on with this project anymore? We&#039;re more than half a month deep into this project with all of the best technology and experts in the industry at our disposal, and nothing to show for it. Am I the only insane one to think that we don&#039;t stand a chance?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have to confront reality, and you hate that. You clutch the notebook tightly. Reading this coming from her is hard. She meant so much to you, and you couldn&#039;t be there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But you know you have to read on, no matter how hard it is; you release your grip on the notebook and flip the page, continuing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;June 23rd, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Well, journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;One of the men returned from the missing group and pulled me aside. They were rambling endlessly on about how they knew what I was feeling and they felt it too. Has Jamie been telling others about our therapy sessions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;The research team has a new toy they want to test out, but from the way the last test went, we&#039;re better off trying to find an exit. I know it&#039;s weird to judge something based on one test, but the others don&#039;t understand the problem at all. It&#039;s a death sentence, and we&#039;re just waiting in jail until the execution happens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;We can&#039;t keep going on like this. Some progress needs to happen. We&#039;re going in circles, wasting our time till it gets here. However, the Robotics engineers think they&#039;ve got it figured out. I&#039;ll see it out, but I have my doubts. I&#039;ll be back with an update.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Update: The little gadget&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;a grenade&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;looking item that emits some kind of burst of light&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;was hucked into the &lt;em&gt;decay&lt;/em&gt;, which seemed to absorb the light, similarly to a black hole. Fucking perfect. If we don&#039;t make any actual progress soon, then I&#039;m going to jump off a proverbial bridge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tears trickle down your cheek as you look down. Your only friend was losing herself. With so much left unanswered, you turn the page with only a sparkle of hope that you can find good news. You notice that half of the page was torn to shreds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Aug 14th, 20##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Journal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;I remember day one. I thought that we could stop this rot. Oh, how naive I was to believe that. Recently, they&#039;ve been involving me more with the experiments. I can see the hopelessness beyond their faux enthusiasm; they all feel the exact same way as me deep down. They just hide it by being workaholics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Well, maybe I can learn something from them. Despite the fact that the new invention has no chance in hell of succeeding, we can at least keep ourselves occupied until the end. The new device acts as both previous inventions&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;a grenade that contains a highly combustible version of &#039;the Elixer.&#039;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Josef&quot;&gt;Upd###: It all happened so quick&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;one moment I held the device in my hands, and the next everyone was on the floor. Jamie, one of the few things that still mattered to me, is gone. Without her, I&#039;d be&amp;#8230; nevermind. Death was bound to be upon me anyway, so it doesn&#039;t matter. Nothing does anymore. It&#039;s a miracle I&#039;ve even survived this long, but hey, at least I&#039;ll get to be with her soon. Maybe there are happy endings sometimes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You attempt to read further, but it&#039;s too ripped for you to discern what it was supposed to say. You had found the answer you sought, but it wasn&#039;t nearly as helpful as you&#039;d hoped. As you look closer to the ground, you notice something under the desk. What is that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s the charred skeletal remains of a corpse. You cover your mouth, holding in vomit, unable to take your eyes off of the remains of your once&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You retrieve the blueprints and leave the room, saying your final goodbyes as you flee back to headquarters. Once you reach headquarters, you tell your boss the mission was a success, and additionally, blueprints have been found. You notice the surprise from his face slowly fade throughout the story when he hands you a letter from a man named &#039;Ron Sacksworth,&#039; who invited you to join them at a new &#039;Final Frontier&#039; base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Deciding to continue what your friend had once started, you bid your co&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;workers farewell. Staying positive is what could make or break this fight. After all, there is no hope nor meaning, except for what you make of it.&lt;br /&gt;

That was until all communications were haphazardly cut. People from your base camp rumored that the <em>decay</em> had already swallowed them whole; others believed they had found an exit.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> These rumors are what propagated the mission &quot;Seared Frontier.&quot; You were assigned a simple task: find out what happened here.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> Scrounging around the barren desks, you stumble across a journal on the floor next to some blueprints, labeled &quot;Heartman,&quot; who you knew as both an assistant researcher in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">the M.E.G.</a> and a friend.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> Immediately flipping to the first page<strong>—</strong>with hopes of finding some sign of what happened<strong>—</strong>you find that the interior remains miraculously largely undamaged. You skim through the page:</p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">June 2nd, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Hey there, journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Today, I've been officially assigned to my first station! It's quite hopeful to see these different kinds of groups coming together to stop this <em>Decay</em> thing. The <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-robotics">Robotics</a> with their ingenuity,<a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-b-n-t-g">the B.N.T.G.</a> with their resources, and the M.E.G. with their research. With all of us<strong>—</strong>along with a few others I didn't mention<strong>—</strong>I feel like we've got a good chance of crushing this decay. I haven't been briefed on what we're going to be doing just yet to end this, but I can't say I'm not interested to find out!</span></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> Skimming the journal, a faint smile is painted across your face. Heartman was inexperienced, which showed in the way she conducted herself. No useful information yet; you skim to the next page:<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">June 9th, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Hey again, journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">It's been a while since I last updated this thing, but a lot has happened since I last wrote. For instance, with our current knowledge, we estimate that it should take only a couple of days to syart experimenting on a possible solution.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">I wonder how long it'll take to get satisfactory results. After all, we all know what's at stake if we don't come up with a solution&#8230; I guess I'm just being a cynic. We've got this. Everyone else is counting on us.</span></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> You furrow your brow. Perhaps the situation was worse than you thought, considering even the always-optimistic Heartman wasn't too sure. You read on.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">June 14th, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Hello, journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">I've been putting overtime into this project. As I'm writing this, we have a couple of different inventions being built. Our one completed project<strong>—</strong>which we're calling the <em>Elixir</em><strong>—</strong>is a compound that utilizes a combination of Backrooms<strong>-</strong>unique materials to kill off the infection.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span class="Josef"><span style="font-size:150%;">Now, I'll be honest, I didn't believe it'd succeed until we tested it on <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-511">Level 511</a>'s destructive phenomenon. When the compound was administered on the phenomenon, it sizzled down to the portion where the infection destroyed its last particle. After this, we weren't able to detect any signs of the phenomenon. It's far from confirmation, but at least we know that it's ready for field testing. I'll write more on this once it's done.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Update: Holy shit that was a disaster. I'd been hyped up to see the fruits of our labor, only for the compound to dissolve in the <em>decay</em>.</span></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> As you read on, you ask yourself whether you could've supported her more. You take your phone and take a picture of the test and the results, moving on to the next page.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">June 17th, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Well, journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">A team of 5 people went missing without a trace this morning. Worse yet, they took both our months of research documents and the device that the Backrooms Robotics was spending their time on.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">What's even the point of going on with this project anymore? We're more than half a month deep into this project with all of the best technology and experts in the industry at our disposal, and nothing to show for it. Am I the only insane one to think that we don't stand a chance?</span></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> You have to confront reality, and you hate that. You clutch the notebook tightly. Reading this coming from her is hard. She meant so much to you, and you couldn't be there.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> But you know you have to read on, no matter how hard it is; you release your grip on the notebook and flip the page, continuing.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">June 23rd, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Well, journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">One of the men returned from the missing group and pulled me aside. They were rambling endlessly on about how they knew what I was feeling and they felt it too. Has Jamie been telling others about our therapy sessions?</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">The research team has a new toy they want to test out, but from the way the last test went, we're better off trying to find an exit. I know it's weird to judge something based on one test, but the others don't understand the problem at all. It's a death sentence, and we're just waiting in jail until the execution happens.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">We can't keep going on like this. Some progress needs to happen. We're going in circles, wasting our time till it gets here. However, the Robotics engineers think they've got it figured out. I'll see it out, but I have my doubts. I'll be back with an update.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Update: The little gadget<strong>—</strong>a grenade<strong>-</strong>looking item that emits some kind of burst of light<strong>—</strong>was hucked into the <em>decay</em>, which seemed to absorb the light, similarly to a black hole. Fucking perfect. If we don't make any actual progress soon, then I'm going to jump off a proverbial bridge.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> Tears trickle down your cheek as you look down. Your only friend was losing herself. With so much left unanswered, you turn the page with only a sparkle of hope that you can find good news. You notice that half of the page was torn to shreds.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <blockquote> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Aug 14th, 20##</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Journal,</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">I remember day one. I thought that we could stop this rot. Oh, how naive I was to believe that. Recently, they've been involving me more with the experiments. I can see the hopelessness beyond their faux enthusiasm; they all feel the exact same way as me deep down. They just hide it by being workaholics.</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Well, maybe I can learn something from them. Despite the fact that the new invention has no chance in hell of succeeding, we can at least keep ourselves occupied until the end. The new device acts as both previous inventions<strong>—</strong>a grenade that contains a highly combustible version of 'the Elixer.'</span></span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="font-size:150%;"><span class="Josef">Upd###: It all happened so quick<strong>—</strong>one moment I held the device in my hands, and the next everyone was on the floor. Jamie, one of the few things that still mattered to me, is gone. Without her, I'd be&#8230; nevermind. Death was bound to be upon me anyway, so it doesn't matter. Nothing does anymore. It's a miracle I've even survived this long, but hey, at least I'll get to be with her soon. Maybe there are happy endings sometimes.</span></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> You attempt to read further, but it's too ripped for you to discern what it was supposed to say. You had found the answer you sought, but it wasn't nearly as helpful as you'd hoped. As you look closer to the ground, you notice something under the desk. What is that?<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> It's the charred skeletal remains of a corpse. You cover your mouth, holding in vomit, unable to take your eyes off of the remains of your once<strong>-</strong>friend.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> You retrieve the blueprints and leave the room, saying your final goodbyes as you flee back to headquarters. Once you reach headquarters, you tell your boss the mission was a success, and additionally, blueprints have been found. You notice the surprise from his face slowly fade throughout the story when he hands you a letter from a man named 'Ron Sacksworth,' who invited you to join them at a new 'Final Frontier' base.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> Deciding to continue what your friend had once started, you bid your co<strong>-</strong>workers farewell. Staying positive is what could make or break this fight. After all, there is no hope nor meaning, except for what you make of it.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <blockquote> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Took this whilst on a ‘ghost hunt’ at an abandoned asylum.<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> Jon Butterworth<br /> <strong>License:</strong> CC0&#160;1.0<br /> <strong>Source Link:</strong> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/hospital-bed-on-concrete-pavement-fmWFJ6pjrTg">https://unsplash.com/photos/hospital-bed-on-concrete-pavement-fmWFJ6pjrTg</a></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/red-eyes-dragoon" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7184922&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713001" alt="Red-eyes Dragoon" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7184922)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/red-eyes-dragoon" >Red-eyes Dragoon</a></span></p>

&lt;div class=&quot;lightblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched them teeter on the precipice of life and death; the void was beckoning them into its shivery embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor soul laid wounded on the gurney, their ichor flowing through their ripped plaid shirt and onto the yellow fabric they were laying on. They reached out, perhaps for a deity, even a prayer. They spoke to me, naught but a whisper as their hand brushed my scrubs, a trail of blood abandoned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grasped their hand as the latex of my gloves squealed against the fresh liquid. The doctor&#039;s voice echoed around me as he sutured their chest wound shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s going to be okay,&amp;quot; I said, manifesting as much confidence as I could. I saw a weak smile curl up the corners of their lips as they closed their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Done!&amp;quot; I jolted into action, pushing the gurney into The Ward. I checked their pulse and blood pressure, both of which were too low for morphine. I quickly administered a bolus of saline and watched the mortal blow striped across their chest rapidly begin to heal, the sinew gently yet efficiently knitting itself back together. Their heart rate stabilized, and the patient&#039;s ragged breathing calmed down. I took a few steps back, sliding down against the wall as I sat next to my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor laughed; I felt warm tears run down my cheeks. This person had been struck down by an uncaring entity so deeply that it was etched into their ribs. If we could save them, we could save so many others. We could help all of the poor souls that wander out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. We could perform miracles here in these rooms. We could save lives not meant to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of this person had changed everything. We finally had a real method of saving lives besides stapling them back together. Beyond saving people from certain death, this opened up the ability for major surgeries and all types of advanced care. The possibilities were endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we could all make it out of here alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diverging paths of Level 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swathed in blinding, pristine white, Level 1.3 stands as a shining bastion amongst the shadowy corridors of the Backrooms. The level is roughly one square mile of white rooms and corridors, floored by unblemished tile made of an unknown, smooth material, which feels almost soft to the touch. The surfaces of the level cannot be sullied by grime and upon being damaged will gradually regenerate. The level proper consists of a lengthy, single hallway with branching paths to the left and right. Each path leads to one of sixteen large rooms, which contain either medical supplies and equipment or an empty area dubbed a &amp;quot;Detox Zone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The level is popular among the sick and injured, as exposure to these Detox Zones will rapidly heal them. Broken bones, grievous wounds, high fevers, and even toxicosis can be cleansed quickly, especially with care from the resident health professionals. While it may seem excessive, the work the care team does only amplifies the healing, as they exercise their knowledge to set up patients for optimal recovery. Patients exposed to the Detox Zones usually leave with heightened immune systems and better overall health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Such a location is highly coveted. As such, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; has committed itself to maintaining the level and protecting its entry. Level 1.3 is easily accessible via Level 1 and M.E.G. operatives can provide guidance to the entrance. Everyone is welcome; however, as the level is small, the M.E.G. manages who enters to help those in need first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The M.E.G. has graciously established a makeshift hospital in Level 1.3. Named &lt;strong&gt;The Ward&lt;/strong&gt;, the injured and seriously ill are sent here to be tended to by a team of health professionals. The Ward is stationed in all eight zones; the doctors there tirelessly assist and provide succor to those in dire need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When exposed to the Detox Zones, most poisons and pathogens are cleaned in mere minutes, although serious and terminal illnesses can take days or even weeks to purify. Broken bones and superficial wounds heal rapidly. Because of how quick the recovery is, it is recommended that a wanderer waits for medical attention prior to entry lest the injuries and broken bones heal incorrectly. The healing process Detox Zones provide, while swift, can be difficult to endure. Many wanderers complain of burning and sharp pain up until their wounds fully finish healing. Properly set wounds or bones yield less pain. Congenital illnesses cannot be cleansed; they persist despite exposure to the Detox Zones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even considering the miraculous healing provided by Level 1.3, The Ward would be nothing without its team of incredible doctors. Over fifteen experts ranging from general practitioners to neurologists work tirelessly to assist wanderers as they seek recovery. The sanitizing properties of the Detox Zones enable uniquely extreme surgeries not accessible anywhere else in the Backrooms. Even the most invasive of heart surgeries can be safe procedures under the skilled hands of the medical team. To ensure optimal care, doctors are screened for their exemplary bedside manner and expertise; only the greatest are selected to provide care. The M.E.G. has scoured the Backrooms to provide only the finest equipment and physicians in order to save as many lives as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Countless have been saved within the confines of the level. While The Ward handles intensive care, the smaller Detox Zones are used for those in need of acute or long-term care. Due to its serendipitous proximity to Base Alpha in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/a&gt;, the injured and sick can quickly receive medical attention. The M.E.G. takes pride in the quality of care and exemplary behavior of their care providers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entrances And Exits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;Level 1.3 can be accessed by no-clipping through a white wall near Base Alpha in Level 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;One may return to Level 1 by no-clipping into either end of the main hallway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M.E.G. has reclassified this level as a &lt;strong&gt;Dead Zone&lt;/strong&gt;. Only sanctioned operatives may enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your cooperation.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several anomalies have been recorded in Level 1.3 following the appearance of what is suspected to be Decay. There have also been reports of the Detox Zones producing strange effects. As such, the M.E.G. has forbidden entry to the level until it has been properly investigated. The following is a collection of documents regarding the potential presence of Decay, collated and prepared for further use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: darkred&quot;&gt;The following documents contain details of blood and gore. One may read at their own risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First of all, allow me to apologize for my horrible handwriting and the informal nature of my report. Despite all of the time I&#039;ve spent in Level 1.3, I&#039;ve been completely unable to heal any of the ongoing nerve damage in my wrist. Regardless, I&#039;ve included the three autopsy reports that you have requested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;To start with case 714: Mr. Stevens had no known allergens included in his case file, yet he died from extreme anaphylactic shock. His skin was coated in rashes and lesions, and the patient had scratched himself so badly that he was unrecognizable. This was likely due to the agony of the allergic reaction. This autoimmune response also attacked his internal organs. His kidneys were heavily damaged, as was his liver and lungs. His eyes were mostly gone; he likely gouged them out himself due to the severity of his symptoms. It appeared to be his own immune system that was the culprit, but he had no other signs of trauma.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-unfolded&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-unfolded-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;collapsible-block-link&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;Close&amp;nbsp;Case&amp;nbsp;#715&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Case 715 was even more strange. On her skin, Miss Richards only had the scar from the hernia surgery she was recovering from. I had to open her up to figure out what was going on, and she was filled with softball-sized tumors. They were putting so much pressure on her heart that she likely suffered from tachycardia, which led to a myocardial infarction and her ultimate demise. Her file reported that she had hypercoagulability. I was expecting to see a few clots, but her blood was almost jelly. Examining the tumors revealed they were likely not malignant, but just collections of overproduced cells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-unfolded-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;collapsible-block-link&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;Close&amp;nbsp;Case&amp;nbsp;#716&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Case 716 is the strangest of them all. Upon cursory glance, I thought someone had mutilated the corpse, but the cuts were splits in the cadaver&#039;s skin. This was a result of internal pressure and the body being chilled for the autopsy. His organs were liquified as a result of having far too much fluid in his body, likely from blood overproduction. The internal pressure fractured bones and ended his life. This is also evident in the ruptured blood vessels in his limbs and in his eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Conclusion: Each victim appeared to suffer from different issues, but there&#039;s a connection between all of them. They each had a systemic, extreme, lethal overproduction or overreaction, as if their bodies had been given instructions a hundred times as extreme as they should have been. What is going on? Perhaps these poor folks will give us a better idea of what&#039;s going on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Regards,&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;darkblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;Document 2: Personal Log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing quite says &amp;quot;hey, you&#039;re expendable,&amp;quot; like sending someone into a collapsing building or a facsimile of one. I hadn&#039;t been to Level 1.3 since I had been struck by a duller. The ensuing infection almost took my life, but the doctors there saved me. I&#039;ll never forget the sharp smell of cleaning chemicals throughout, strong enough to give you a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was terrified. How bad could the level be to be reclassified as something uninhabitable? I personally saw some of the fucked up corpses carted out, patients who were seeking recovery but who only found death. They were mangled in bizarre ways, all impossible. There were rumors, rumors that something had corrupted the level, changed the way it healed people. Why the hell were they sending me of all people in here? Just my luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of security at the door, more so than ever. Burly men and women with menacing looking weapons. I flashed my ID and no-clipped through the white wall that led to the level. Thankfully, this was one of the gentler entrances; it was basically walking through the wall. A wash of rancid air hit my face, the humidity only adding to my discomfort. What I saw almost made me turn right around. The level was buckling under its own weight. Black spots were scattered everywhere, and the normally rigid white walls were &lt;em&gt;bending&lt;/em&gt; and caving into the irregular spots of pure blackness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was worse than a collapsing building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotten stench was certainly from the corpses that were now locked away in the crumbling corners of this forsaken place. I had read a report that only three patients had been recovered. The rest were left behind without a proper burial, rotting away into the gathering abyss. I grimaced but endured the scent, unspooling the fishing line I had been given. I carefully sidled up to the nearest pit and measured out about a yard of line. I gingerly lowered it into the hole and allowed it to dangle for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yanked the plastic wire out, returning less than a foot of it to me. My heart sank into my chest; this was absolutely Decay. I tossed the rest of the line into the hole before carefully standing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know what it was, perhaps hubris, but my morbid curiosity took over. How did those people die? What happened to this place that had once saved my life? I walked deeper into the level, avoiding potholes and warping walls. Streaks of oxidized blood ran brown across the ground, long since dried and encrusted onto the tile floor. That was probably the most out-of-place thing here. The brown-red blood was almost jarring against the level’s perfect white and black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning left, I headed down the corridor and arrived at a well-marked section, The Ward. The beginning of the Detox Zone was marked with green tape, sectioning off the area that was once used to save my very life. Most of it was gone, a gaping abyss. I shivered as the fear started to take root in my body. Perhaps people could still be healed; perhaps they could be saved. I took my utility knife from my belt and made a small slice on my forearm. I sidled up to the green markers and pushed my hand gingerly across the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. My fingertips tingled, but it was likely just nerves. With more confidence, I thrusted my arm deeper into the Detox Zone. A familiar burning sensation ran down my arm, my wound beginning to itch. A grin spread across my face as the cut began to scab away and heal. My smile quickly faded as the surrounding skin began to bubble and tear. The fresh, red flesh that had closed the wound began to peel back, revealing more churning meat beneath. I ripped my arm back, but it had all happened too quickly. I stumbled away in absolute shock as blood and skin dripped from my now horribly deformed limb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;darkblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;Document 3: Director&#039;s Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been several weeks since our scout returned from Level 1.3. His arm, or what was left of it, was amputated shortly after his visit. I had specifically asked him to test one of the holes and then leave, but he is young and brash. I just needed to know if it was Decay, but I foolishly underestimated just how dangerous the level had become. I didn&#039;t want to incite any more panic amongst our ranks, but now everyone has started to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, we wouldn&#039;t covet a level like this, but with the Decay issue slowly spiraling, we had to protect our most important assets. Between the corpses examined by Dr. Reathe and our scout&#039;s reaction to the Detox Zone, it is clear that the level is no longer of any use to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped it would have been salvageable, but we can&#039;t even no-clip into the level anymore. Except for the bloodshed, it is as if it never existed. I wonder how many worlds will be lost to the Decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear for the people living in this strange dimension and for their futures. Existential dread continues to mount in my heart day by day. What if we can&#039;t stop this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will it end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They reached out, perhaps for a deity, even a prayer. They spoke to me, naught but a whisper as their hand brushed my scrubs, a trail of blood abandoned there.</p> <p>I grasped their hand as the latex of my gloves squealed against the fresh liquid. The doctor's voice echoed around me as he sutured their chest wound shut.</p> <p>&quot;It's going to be okay,&quot; I said, manifesting as much confidence as I could. I saw a weak smile curl up the corners of their lips as they closed their eyes.</p> <p>&quot;Done!&quot; I jolted into action, pushing the gurney into The Ward. I checked their pulse and blood pressure, both of which were too low for morphine. I quickly administered a bolus of saline and watched the mortal blow striped across their chest rapidly begin to heal, the sinew gently yet efficiently knitting itself back together. Their heart rate stabilized, and the patient's ragged breathing calmed down. I took a few steps back, sliding down against the wall as I sat next to my colleagues.</p> <p>The doctor laughed; I felt warm tears run down my cheeks. This person had been struck down by an uncaring entity so deeply that it was etched into their ribs. If we could save them, we could save so many others. We could help all of the poor souls that wander out of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a> and beyond. We could perform miracles here in these rooms. We could save lives not meant to be saved.</p> <p>The healing of this person had changed everything. We finally had a real method of saving lives besides stapling them back together. Beyond saving people from certain death, this opened up the ability for major surgeries and all types of advanced care. The possibilities were endless.</p> <p>Maybe we could all make it out of here alive.</p> </div> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <div class="sd-container"> <div class="top-box class-0 color-{$color}"> <div class="header-diamond"> <div class="bg"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-color class-0 color-{$color}"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-pattern"></div> <div class="diamondy diamond-image class-0 {$image}"></div> </div> <div class="gradient-box"> <div class="top-text"> <p>SURVIVAL DIFFICULTY:</p> </div> <div class="bottom-text"> <p>Class 0</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bottom-box class-0"> <ul> <li><span class="{$one}">{$one}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> <li><span class="{$two}">{$two}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> <li><span class="{$three}">{$three}</span><span class="default"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> <h6><span><strong>Description</strong></span></h6> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-1-3/halls.png" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>The diverging paths of Level 1.3.</p> </div> </div> <p>Swathed in blinding, pristine white, Level 1.3 stands as a shining bastion amongst the shadowy corridors of the Backrooms. The level is roughly one square mile of white rooms and corridors, floored by unblemished tile made of an unknown, smooth material, which feels almost soft to the touch. The surfaces of the level cannot be sullied by grime and upon being damaged will gradually regenerate. The level proper consists of a lengthy, single hallway with branching paths to the left and right. Each path leads to one of sixteen large rooms, which contain either medical supplies and equipment or an empty area dubbed a &quot;Detox Zone.&quot;<br /> <br /> The level is popular among the sick and injured, as exposure to these Detox Zones will rapidly heal them. Broken bones, grievous wounds, high fevers, and even toxicosis can be cleansed quickly, especially with care from the resident health professionals. While it may seem excessive, the work the care team does only amplifies the healing, as they exercise their knowledge to set up patients for optimal recovery. Patients exposed to the Detox Zones usually leave with heightened immune systems and better overall health.<br /> <br /> Such a location is highly coveted. As such, the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">M.E.G.</a> has committed itself to maintaining the level and protecting its entry. Level 1.3 is easily accessible via Level 1 and M.E.G. operatives can provide guidance to the entrance. Everyone is welcome; however, as the level is small, the M.E.G. manages who enters to help those in need first.<br /> <br /></p> <h6><span><strong>The Ward</strong></span></h6> <p><br /> The M.E.G. has graciously established a makeshift hospital in Level 1.3. Named <strong>The Ward</strong>, the injured and seriously ill are sent here to be tended to by a team of health professionals. The Ward is stationed in all eight zones; the doctors there tirelessly assist and provide succor to those in dire need.<br /> <br /> When exposed to the Detox Zones, most poisons and pathogens are cleaned in mere minutes, although serious and terminal illnesses can take days or even weeks to purify. Broken bones and superficial wounds heal rapidly. Because of how quick the recovery is, it is recommended that a wanderer waits for medical attention prior to entry lest the injuries and broken bones heal incorrectly. The healing process Detox Zones provide, while swift, can be difficult to endure. Many wanderers complain of burning and sharp pain up until their wounds fully finish healing. Properly set wounds or bones yield less pain. Congenital illnesses cannot be cleansed; they persist despite exposure to the Detox Zones.<br /> <br /> Even considering the miraculous healing provided by Level 1.3, The Ward would be nothing without its team of incredible doctors. Over fifteen experts ranging from general practitioners to neurologists work tirelessly to assist wanderers as they seek recovery. The sanitizing properties of the Detox Zones enable uniquely extreme surgeries not accessible anywhere else in the Backrooms. Even the most invasive of heart surgeries can be safe procedures under the skilled hands of the medical team. To ensure optimal care, doctors are screened for their exemplary bedside manner and expertise; only the greatest are selected to provide care. The M.E.G. has scoured the Backrooms to provide only the finest equipment and physicians in order to save as many lives as possible.<br /> <br /> Countless have been saved within the confines of the level. While The Ward handles intensive care, the smaller Detox Zones are used for those in need of acute or long-term care. Due to its serendipitous proximity to Base Alpha in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1">Level 1</a>, the injured and sick can quickly receive medical attention. The M.E.G. takes pride in the quality of care and exemplary behavior of their care providers.<br /> <br /></p> <h6><span><strong>Entrances And Exits</strong></span></h6> <p><br /> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Level 1.3 can be accessed by no-clipping through a white wall near Base Alpha in Level 1.</span><br /> <br /> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">One may return to Level 1 by no-clipping into either end of the main hallway.</span></p> <div style="--link-color: 255, 0, 0;"> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">Click to Open Attached Documents</a><a href="javascript:;">Close Documents</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"> <div style="--link-color: var(--pale-accent);"> <h3><span><span style="color: red">WARNING</span></span></h3> <p>The M.E.G. has reclassified this level as a <strong>Dead Zone</strong>.

There have also been reports of the Detox Zones producing strange effects. As such, the M.E.G. has forbidden entry to the level until it has been properly investigated.

His skin was coated in rashes and lesions, and the patient had scratched himself so badly that he was unrecognizable. This was likely due to the agony of the allergic reaction. This autoimmune response also attacked his internal organs. His kidneys were heavily damaged, as was his liver and lungs. His eyes were mostly gone; he likely gouged them out himself due to the severity of his symptoms.

On her skin, Miss Richards only had the scar from the hernia surgery she was recovering from. I had to open her up to figure out what was going on, and she was filled with softball-sized tumors. They were putting so much pressure on her heart that she likely suffered from tachycardia, which led to a myocardial infarction and her ultimate demise. Her file reported that she had hypercoagulability. I was expecting to see a few clots, but her blood was almost jelly.

Upon cursory glance, I thought someone had mutilated the corpse, but the cuts were splits in the cadaver's skin. This was a result of internal pressure and the body being chilled for the autopsy. His organs were liquified as a result of having far too much fluid in his body, likely from blood overproduction. The internal pressure fractured bones and ended his life. This is also evident in the ruptured blood vessels in his limbs and in his eyes.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Conclusion: Each victim appeared to suffer from different issues, but there's a connection between all of them. They each had a systemic, extreme, lethal overproduction or overreaction, as if their bodies had been given instructions a hundred times as extreme as they should have been. What is going on? Perhaps these poor folks will give us a better idea of what's going on.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Regards,</em> <p><em>Dr. Edward Reathe</em><br /></p> </div> <hr /> <div class="darkblock"> <h5><span><em><span style="color: red">Document 2: Personal Log</span></em></span></h5> <p>Nothing quite says &quot;hey, you're expendable,&quot; like sending someone into a collapsing building or a facsimile of one. I hadn't been to Level 1.3 since I had been struck by a duller. The ensuing infection almost took my life, but the doctors there saved me. I'll never forget the sharp smell of cleaning chemicals throughout, strong enough to give you a headache.</p> <p>I was terrified. How bad could the level be to be reclassified as something uninhabitable? I personally saw some of the fucked up corpses carted out, patients who were seeking recovery but who only found death. They were mangled in bizarre ways, all impossible. There were rumors, rumors that something had corrupted the level, changed the way it healed people. Why the hell were they sending me of all people in here? Just my luck.</p> <p>There was a lot of security at the door, more so than ever. Burly men and women with menacing looking weapons. I flashed my ID and no-clipped through the white wall that led to the level. Thankfully, this was one of the gentler entrances; it was basically walking through the wall. A wash of rancid air hit my face, the humidity only adding to my discomfort. What I saw almost made me turn right around. The level was buckling under its own weight. Black spots were scattered everywhere, and the normally rigid white walls were <em>bending</em> and caving into the irregular spots of pure blackness.</p> <p>This was worse than a collapsing building.</p> <p>The rotten stench was certainly from the corpses that were now locked away in the crumbling corners of this forsaken place. I had read a report that only three patients had been recovered. The rest were left behind without a proper burial, rotting away into the gathering abyss. I grimaced but endured the scent, unspooling the fishing line I had been given. I carefully sidled up to the nearest pit and measured out about a yard of line. I gingerly lowered it into the hole and allowed it to dangle for a few moments.</p> <p>I yanked the plastic wire out, returning less than a foot of it to me. My heart sank into my chest; this was absolutely Decay. I tossed the rest of the line into the hole before carefully standing up.</p> <p>I don't know what it was, perhaps hubris, but my morbid curiosity took over. How did those people die? What happened to this place that had once saved my life? I walked deeper into the level, avoiding potholes and warping walls. Streaks of oxidized blood ran brown across the ground, long since dried and encrusted onto the tile floor. That was probably the most out-of-place thing here. The brown-red blood was almost jarring against the level’s perfect white and black.</p> <p>Turning left, I headed down the corridor and arrived at a well-marked section, The Ward. The beginning of the Detox Zone was marked with green tape, sectioning off the area that was once used to save my very life. Most of it was gone, a gaping abyss. I shivered as the fear started to take root in my body. Perhaps people could still be healed; perhaps they could be saved. I took my utility knife from my belt and made a small slice on my forearm. I sidled up to the green markers and pushed my hand gingerly across the threshold.</p> <p>Nothing. My fingertips tingled, but it was likely just nerves. With more confidence, I thrusted my arm deeper into the Detox Zone. A familiar burning sensation ran down my arm, my wound beginning to itch. A grin spread across my face as the cut began to scab away and heal. My smile quickly faded as the surrounding skin began to bubble and tear. The fresh, red flesh that had closed the wound began to peel back, revealing more churning meat beneath. I ripped my arm back, but it had all happened too quickly. I stumbled away in absolute shock as blood and skin dripped from my now horribly deformed limb.</p> </div> <div class="darkblock"> <h5><span><em><span style="color: red">Document 3: Director's Note</span></em></span></h5> <p>It has been several weeks since our scout returned from Level 1.3. His arm, or what was left of it, was amputated shortly after his visit. I had specifically asked him to test one of the holes and then leave, but he is young and brash. I just needed to know if it was Decay, but I foolishly underestimated just how dangerous the level had become. I didn't want to incite any more panic amongst our ranks, but now everyone has started to talk.</p> <p>Normally, we wouldn't covet a level like this, but with the Decay issue slowly spiraling, we had to protect our most important assets. Between the corpses examined by Dr. Reathe and our scout's reaction to the Detox Zone, it is clear that the level is no longer of any use to us.</p> <p>I had hoped it would have been salvageable, but we can't even no-clip into the level anymore. Except for the bloodshed, it is as if it never existed. I wonder how many worlds will be lost to the Decay.</p> <p>I fear for the people living in this strange dimension and for their futures. Existential dread continues to mount in my heart day by day. What if we can't stop this?</p> <p>Where will it end?</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1-2">Level 1.2</a> | Level 1.3 | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1-4">Level √2</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Render of White Halls</strong><br /> <strong>Author: Alfarex</strong><br /> <strong>License: CC by 3.0</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Renders of Decay Halls</strong><br /> <strong>Author: Alfarex</strong><br /> <strong>License: CC by 3.0</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>714</strong><br /> <strong>Author: DivineAtlas</strong><br /> <strong>License: CC by 3.0</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>715</strong><br /> <strong>Author: DivineAtlas</strong><br /> <strong>License: CC by 3.0</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>716</strong><br /> <strong>Author: DivineAtlas</strong><br /> <strong>License: CC by 3.0</strong></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/divineatlas" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8037742&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713001" alt="DivineAtlas" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8037742)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/divineatlas" >DivineAtlas</a></span></p>

&lt;tt&gt;This is the account of Ayesha.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ground is damp and cold and nothing. Icy water puddles onto the floor from somewhere above, darkness coating her eyes. The water is cruel to her stiff, dry tongue. Her hands, though she cannot see them, catch the only salvation, satisfying her thirst with the freezing source. She gulps it deeply, and there, where she sits, she is content, if only for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She steps back after drinking, back against the chilly concrete, and sighs. She &lt;em&gt;looks around&lt;/em&gt;, from right to left, left to right, top to bottom, bottom to top&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;all is dark. Still, she cannot tell the difference between the shutting and opening of her eyes anyway, so why should she &lt;em&gt;look around&lt;/em&gt;? Whether it is simply human instincts or some subconscious desire that compels her to &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;, she knows that it is for a purpose unbeknownst to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, once more, she looks left and right and left and&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her guiding moonlight shining upon Her and her Tom(b)e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8230;MOONLIGHT pierces her void-bathed eyes, blinding her with cold, silent contempt.&lt;/strong&gt; She shrieks in agony and retreats deep into the darkness; she finally knows her eyes were open the whole time. The room is invisible black, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-3&quot;&gt;no light penetrates here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this revelation of hers that she realizes what she has become: a creature of the dark, fearful of the light. Her skin is sickly grey against the moonlight, her limbs so devoid of muscle and flesh and life that she can no longer be called human. It is a horrifying certainty that she cannot deny. Terror pervades her mind when voices from the oblivion whisper into her ears, beckoning her to reveal herself to the sky, to feel the moon&#039;s light once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her fragile fingers feel for a crack from where the moonlight leaks. Then, a white spark bounces off her hand, and for a fleeting moment, she is mesmerized by the silver light. But in the corner of her eyes was sinister made real, a manifestation of oblivion on the black surface, which is not as invisible as that absolute black. It is a tome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation. Euphoria! The pages of such dark understanding are nigh incomprehensible to a being like her. Thus she says: &amp;quot;If oblivion is good and the darkness is just, I shall say the word and my soul shall be healed.&amp;quot; And there is no longer nothing with her and she has become the tomb and the tomb has become her. For she was Ayesha and Ayesha is the tomb.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;This is the account of Crowhurst.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus he said to the sea: &amp;quot;If the sea is that deep, how come I could see the bottom of it?&amp;quot; And the bottom was nothing, and he was correct. &amp;quot;The boundary that exists between me and the bottom is merely a mass of liquid state, which propagates undulations like a blanket in the wind. If there was no such boundary, the bottom would merely be nothing.&amp;quot; And it was so. There was nothing on the bottom of the sea and there was a growing oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its wake, it dripped tears of seawater into nothing and it became oblivion too. On the third day, the leak had turned into a faucet of running seawater. &amp;quot;If there was such a case and if my conjecture of the bottom of the sea is truly nothing, then the sea would also be nothing as it is consumed by the nothing that rests at the bottom of it.&amp;quot; And it was so. There was a growing hole and it was drinking the water with an endless stomach. &amp;quot;And if it is so, I am a genius and I serve the nothing.&amp;quot; And it was so, and he is a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his fifth day on the sea, he said to it: &amp;quot;There is nothing that awaits my sloop at the bottom of the sea and I know not when my sloop shall be drank like an ant on a glass of water.&amp;quot; And it was so, and he knew not and needn&#039;t know that he was being drunk like an ant on a glass of water. In this period, the faucet had grown to be a waterfall and the waterfall streamed down and it too became nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his ninth day, he was descending. &amp;quot;It does seem I am correct and the bottom is nothing and I am being drunk like an ant on a glass of water and my guest who drinks the water does not forgive and contains an endless stomach.&amp;quot; On his thirteenth day, the sea was nothing and this proved Crowhurst&#039;s Conjecture, now law: &lt;em&gt;if the bottom of the sea is truly nothing, then the sea would also be nothing as it is consumed by the nothing that rests at the bottom of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all this is true, then the nothingness and the guest with an endless stomach shall drink all the seas and shall still be thirsty after and eat of the land as its breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and still yet be hungry and eat the skies as its dessert. To Crowhurst, who was now drunk like an ant on a glass of water, he knew that this was merely a waiting game. The guest with an endless stomach wants to play it forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;This is the account of Daedalus.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The sun had grown an eye. It is as if some clean black ink had been dropped right on its face, which glowed ever-radiantly. It was also growing, the masses could not see it but it was growing, I knew of this because of my son. A deep desire ate away at his soul, a fixation that neither the gods nor men could quake. But I quaked for him. Terror ate at my soul as my eyes lingered on the fanatic, frantic, fearful thing I once called a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, I saw his eyes change, too. He preached the sun&#039;s eye as if it is some malignant deity who wished destruction to everything in its sight. He spouted hysterical controversies and spited those who took his word for nothing or merely entertaining. For he was a dreamer, and though this dream was not so bright, he pursued it like moth to a flame. He took to the skies with wax-made wings to see the great dark eye closer. He flew with elegance and zeal for his cause, and I could do nothing but watch as he slowly merged into the eye. For it was not an eye but a mouth, and it kept on eating until the sky had turned an absolute nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see that the masses that once gave no care to the eye were now moving with desperation, driving them to the brink of madness. Cities fell, and walls crumbled. The eye now ate at mankind and came crashing down with an uncaring end. The only two feelings that remained as the mouth began to shroud each corner of the world in absolute darkness were the acceptance and fear of the eye. I am one of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quaked for the world. I quaked for the people. I quaked for my son as my arms reached for him as he flew into that mouth, vanished into a cold iris that gazed deep into my mind, soul, and being. Nothing remains now as I feel nothing. For I too have become the mouth that eats away at the souls of the masses and I have become what my son and all the sons in the world desired: a mouth, an eye, a nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;This is the account of Salvio.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dream was merely a piece of the truth, for I had seen it all. It was in the seams of my clothes and the darkness that pervaded the alleys in the night. Although these were temporary, they were places with hints of what was to come. They were places where cold, permanent darkness would eventually manifest. This cold darkness was neither a construct nor a god, but a means of purification to bring the state of reality into nothing. It made it all the more a faith everlasting in both heart and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had become enlightened by this fact through the practices that it had shown me in my visions, to strip everything to the minimum, become numb from all mortal pain, and abandon the places where mortal satisfaction and pleasure were once acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place where all things belong is in the nothingness where consciousness and life cannot even dare to breach. It lingers in the mind and creates a hole from which permeates the truth: to become nothing. For we were once nothing before we were even given the curse of being something. Thus, it is only moral to return to that state. A state wherein the soul neither accepts nor denies what happens to it. This is a reason to be happy because this curse is a hindrance to the state of being truly free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certain that my discovery of the Decay is the next step for human evolution and that it is something to be proud of. There is no better way than to accept what is inevitable, for knowing nothing is the beginning of wisdom. The beginning of wisdom, true wisdom, is within the void. There is a saying that no monetary value will ever compare to the feeling of self-satisfaction. This satisfaction drives my faith in oblivion. It is what all others must see. There is no grander purpose in this curse than to return from it to the truth that enveloped us in its embrace before we were even realized based on the stupidity that is chance.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the words of Satisfaction, Purity, and Happiness.&lt;br /&gt;
These are the first words of the Tome.&lt;br /&gt;
They shall be recited on the 12th Hour of every day.&lt;br /&gt;
They shall be recited with honesty and compassion.&lt;br /&gt;
These are the first sacred texts of the Tome.&lt;br /&gt;
They shall be respected and fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;
They shall be given a sacrifice on the 12th Hour of every day.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no grander purpose in this curse than to return from it to the truth that enveloped us in its embrace before we were even realized based on the stupidity that is chance.<br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <hr /> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <div class="lightblock"> <p>These are the words of Satisfaction, Purity, and Happiness.<br /> These are the first words of the Tome.<br /> They shall be recited on the 12th Hour of every day.<br /> They shall be recited with honesty and compassion.<br /> These are the first sacred texts of the Tome.<br /> They shall be respected and fulfilled.<br /> They shall be given a sacrifice on the 12th Hour of every day.</p> <p><em>~ Salvio</em></p> </div> <br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></div> <br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <hr /> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> &quot;Dark Cave Factory Atmo.wav&quot;<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> call-of-the-void<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> szegvari<br /> <strong>License:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=openverse">CC0 1.0</a><br /> <strong>Source Link:</strong> <a href="https://openverse.org/audio/01d702a5-2658-451b-96bc-03e641ed9869">https://openverse.org/audio/01d702a5-2658-451b-96bc-03e641ed9869</a></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> &quot;15033236286_e5243be60a_o.jpg&quot;<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> my-guiding-moonlight<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/greyloch/">greyloch</a><br /> <strong>License:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA 2.0</a><br /> <strong>Source Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/greyloch/15033236286/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/greyloch/15033236286/</a></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7844614&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713001" alt="Schulzenreich" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7844614)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich" >Schulzenreich</a></span></p>

We had vast fields of fertile crops <strong>—</strong> I'd frolic in them with my older brother in my youth <strong>—</strong> huge forests with all sorts of wonderful and curious creatures crawling around every corner or dead stump, and of course there was the big city. I'd go there with my uncle on special occasions, eating at the fancy restaurants and diners or buying some delicious sweets. But most notable of all, there were the mountains. They glistened brilliantly on the horizon with every sunset and sunrise, beaming back the moonlight to make sure no night was too dark. From my farmhouse on the outskirts of the island, we had the clearest view of them of anyone else, and at the time, I took great pride in that. My classmates would call me &quot;Adam the countryboy&quot;, and I really didn't mind it. This was my life: wake up, care for the animals, go to school, and go home to play in the fields until the mountains turned a pretty orange.</em></p> <p><em>One day, my elder brother, Charlie, came home drenched in sweat and covered in bruises and dirt, but more elated than ever. He, 18 at the time, had made the treacherous trek up the mountains and had seen something that we kids were never supposed to see <strong>—</strong> the great blue sea. He fabled a world far away from the one we knew <strong>&#8212;</strong> a world beyond this watery border. I called him crazy and told him to rest, but his words, in actuality, ignited a fire inside my heart. I was plagued with the insomnia that comes with having a beating heart, whereas he slept like a baby. &quot;Could there be a whole new world beyond the mountains and even the sea that I'd only heard of in legends? When our island was already so big and vast, was there still more left to be discovered? I thought I'd seen it all, but perhaps there could be more&quot;. Grandpa told many tales of such lands, but my mother and father would always scold him when he talked of oceans, jungles, and buildings that reached the clouds. It all became a reality in my mind, and for the next few weeks, I trained my body and snuck small rations to prepare for one of my brother's ventures. He said that there were adults that sat upon walls in the outer mountains. &quot;What could they be hiding from us? It just isn't fair. We should be allowed to leave the island if we want to, to go out and explore the world beyond&quot;. Or so I had thought.</em></p> <p><em>My brother raised the idea with our parents once at the dinner table, and he was met firmly with a slap in the face. They had never disciplined us before. If anything, they were too focused on managing the farm to pay us much attention at all aside from the silent meetings at the dinner table. Having never been talked back to for his whole life, this sudden reaction set my brother off. He went running to the mountains once more, and I ran after him, but he was much faster than my little legs could carry me. As we ascended and descended the mountains, I, for the first time, managed to follow him all the way to shore, where it seemed he had constructed a makeshift raft to try to cross the seas. He left me there <strong>—</strong> just as I ran along the coastline, he set off. I screamed and shouted and even tried to swim, but the shore swept me in with each try. He smiled back at me and waved just as he paddled past the strong inner current, and suddenly it all made sense to me. My emotions were calmed, and I smiled back softly. &quot;Make sure you come home safe, Charl! I'd better see you again soon!&quot; I exclaimed. Just as he flipped his thumb, a colossal being <strong>—</strong> it must've been at least five times the size of my house <strong>—</strong> sprung up from the ocean, its fangs sharper than swords and its thousands of beady, crimson eyes glaring my way as it swallowed my poor brother whole. I didn't yell. In fact, I didn't make a single sound. I didn't let myself. I spun around and made a run for the cliff.</em></p> <p><em>I struggled up the mountain as rocks battered down on me for the climb. I slid down the inner walls and scraped and gashed my back on a piece of rebar. I idly walked through the tall grass and into the fields, the marshes drenching my feet and making a squelch with each step. Until I reached my doorstep, my bedroom, my bed, and the end of my dreams, it played over and over again in my head. This must be why the adults didn't want us to know about the outside world <strong>—</strong> to not get our hopes up. Unfortunately, my parents never thought to engrain that lesson into us, or any lesson at all besides the farm's upkeep, for that matter.</em></p> <p><em>My life became bleak from then on. I had no more ambitions <strong>—</strong> I drifted into a well-paying job deep in the city doing office work. I was drowning in papers, but at least my parents were happy to be in the centre of the island. They never spoke of my brother anymore. It was as if he never existed. My uncle had managed our farmland on his own now, but in his old age, I was asked to check up on him just before my 21st birthday. I talked with him for a while about my father; apparently, he used to be just like my late brother. He was full of dreams of going out to sea and escaping this land; he and his best friend were only encouraged by my grandfather's careless motivation. My uncle warned them of the dangers, but they never listened to him. His friend was swallowed up in a similar fashion to my brother, and my father himself was on the boat with him. He narrowly escaped, albeit leaving behind his left eye, which I'd never bothered to question. It made sense to me why he didn't want anything to do with my grandfather anymore and that he would hit my brother for mentioning escape. That conversation brought me back to my senses, I suppose. The break from the endless piles of paperwork opened my eyes.</em></p> <p><em>I was brought back to who I once was, my eyes recovering their hopeful glow. I felt as though I was being strangled and constricted, that there was no place I could go on this island that would appease my reignited hunger for adventure. In the coming years, I travelled nation to nation and town to town on the island, yet no matter how many taverns, government buildings, or mountains I witnessed, I was left deeply dissatisfied, carrying a burden that grew heavier with each step. As I finally returned home, at a ripe 25 years of age, I found myself in my brother's old room. I browsed the relic of time, allowing the nostalgia to wash over me, disturbing the dust that had built up over the years. As I remembered the only times when I was happy with my brother, something caught my eye. There was a journal that sat open, untouched, laying peacefully on his bed. As I picked it up and flipped through the pages, tears flowed down my face for the first time since his death.</em></p> <div class="lightblock"> <p><strong>I'm going to end up leaving for the other side of the great blue soon. Brother, I hope you understand why I'm leaving you here. I want to experience the world anew; it wouldn't be real if I wasn't alone on the journey. Even though it's been wonderful having you by my side all this time, every man needs time to himself every now and then. I can't stay with my 12-year-old little brother forever. However, I want to see you again some day. Come find me, brother. Cross the seas and let us meet. I've left a sword buried just beneath the sand at the spot where we watch the waves crash by — my friend gave me a pretty good deal on it — so use it to conquer one half of the world while I conquer the other. I'm sorry, and I love you, brother.</strong></p> </div> <p>I knew that it was stupid. I knew that it was dangerous and that I would probably die trying. But I didn't care anymore <strong>—</strong> I didn't want to continue living this meaningless life trapped on this drab island until I died of old age, and I wanted to finish what my brother had started. It's what he would've wanted. I moved in with my uncle and restarted what my brother had left for me. The spark of wonder relit my pupils, burning as bright as the stars that lit the night sky as I constructed my vessel, trained to exhaustion, and gazed into infinity once my work was done.</p> <p>Day after day, plank by plank, nail by nail, the vessel sprouted up, as did I. I ceaselessly struck the mountainside with my fists until they were bloody and raw, and I swung the sword until I could cut clean through the stone.</p> <p>To test the fruits of my efforts, I departed for the big city, where they trained their strongest swordsmen to act as guards, their swords and batons paling in comparison to the priceless treasure that my brother had left to me <strong>—</strong> it was sitting in the sand, just as my brother had left it. I approached the training ground on the edge of the city, my sturdy hand<strong>-</strong>made boots stomping on the cobblestone road, hard enough for my footsteps to echo into the facility, which was a massive cabin with a fenced set of arenas behind it. The wooden doors swung open as a six<strong>-</strong>and<strong>-</strong>a<strong>-</strong>half<strong>-</strong>foot<strong>-</strong>tall, burly, bearded man greeted me.</p> <p>He scanned me up and down and said, &quot;Who do you think you are, waltzing here with that much of an ego? Quit the clamor if you know what's good for you. If you're here to train for the militia, you best be ready for a beating with that attitude,&quot; the man boomed.</p> <p>I was quite taken aback, but I managed to keep my composure.</p> <p>&quot;That's quite the way to introduce yourself. I'm assuming that you're a higher<strong>-</strong>up here, judging by your looks&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Course I am. What's it to 'ya, bud?&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, it's not all too important. Could you show me to the arena? It took a lot of holding back during my independent training not to come here <strong>—</strong> had to keep my ego in check until I had the skills to back it up,&quot; I replied.</p> <p>He stared for a few seconds, squinting so that his bushy eyebrows covered his eyes completely. Then he turned around, motioning for me to follow him, accompanying it with a heavy grunt.</p> <p>We entered the building's main hall, which acted as a cafeteria, a reception counter, and a shop all at once. On the left side was a massive grid of wooden tables and benches filled with men that were feasting as if they hadn't eaten in weeks; the food on their plates could only be likened to complete slop. Dishing out this &quot;food&quot; was a middle-aged woman who possessed an odd resemblance to the man that was in front of me. To the right was a smithy occupied by a dozen or so men, with weapons and armour hung on the walls all around them. They looked to be of comparable quality to my sword, though they paled in comparison when it came to looks and sentimental value. Along the back wall was the registry, sectioned into 10 booths, all of which were taken up by men who filled their clothes quite well.</p> <p>Just left of the tills and behind all of the tables, there was a hallway leading to changerooms, which was where the man took me.</p> <p>&quot;Don't I have to sign up to train here? Though I won't complain if I don't, since I'd like to make this quick if possible&quot;.</p> <p>The man peered over his shoulder at me and said, &quot;You really do know how to piss people off, don't 'cha? If you're so desperate for some action, quit yer yammerin' and get goin'&quot;.</p> <p>He returned to pacing down the hallway, then past the changerooms towards a set of doors at the end of it, exiting the building onto a gravel pathway. Ahead of us were training grounds sectioned into a few different areas: sprawling dirt flatlands where men clashed swords freely and honed their technique without restriction; parts of these open areas were fenced off from the rest, populated by training dummies and targets; and lastly, further down the pathway were rope<strong>-</strong>bordered arenas that acted as the setting for various 1-on-1 battles. Just ahead of us, there were barrels of weapons and armour. We approached the barrels.</p> <p>&quot;Grab some gear. You're gonna need it.&quot; said the man.</p> <p>&quot;Ah, sure, I'll take you up on that offer. I wouldn't want to waste my precious sword's edge on some small fries.&quot; I taunted, plucking out a drabby, chipped blade from the pile.</p> <p>The man chuckled, leading me to spectate a battle between two men sitting at about six feet tall, and being of similar builds to myself, at least from what was visible beyond their thick steel armour. They each held swords of the same quality, and possessed similar armour, but the difference in strength and skill was obvious. The man with flowing blonde hair escaping his headguard <strong>—</strong> he was a tough opponent. He deflected each attack masterfully, using his momentum to strike blow after blow onto his partner with such fluid motion that it seemed to be over in a mere instant. The two shook hands, and the loser quickly scurried away to the changerooms to assess the damage.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, Chris, this boy's asking for a beating! Said he was itchin' to fight, but didn't bother throwing on any armour or picking out a half-decent blade, all the while talkin' smack. Don't hold back yeah? Make sure he learns a lesson.&quot;</p> <p>The bearded man shoved me forward, forcing me to stumble over the ropes and into the arena. I approached, and the blonde man unmasked himself, revealing ocean-blue eyes and smooth, white skin. He could be likened to Prince Charming, or some other knight from the fables you'd hear as a kid. He smiled, reaching his hand out to greet me.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, the name's Christopher. As for yourself?&quot;</p> <p>I hesitantly accepted his handshake, feeling his firm grip squeeze my hand.</p> <p>&quot;I'm Adam. Nice to meet you.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The boss can be a bit harsh at times, but you really should've brought armour and a decent blade. You could get hurt.&quot; Chris said.</p> <p>I'd felt that something was off with him, as though he was acting or putting on a show.</p> <p>&quot;Sure man, whatever you say. Can we just start now?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ah, of course. Don't let me delay us any further!&quot; Chris exclaimed, stepping back his left foot and slipping his headpiece back on and holding his blade up firmly in front of him with his right hand.</p> <p>Holding my sword, I took a relaxed stance with my arms at my sides, awaiting the start signal from the bearded man whose name I'd just realized I'd never caught.</p> <p>&quot;Begin!&quot; he shouted, and with that, Chris lunged forward.</p> <p>The fact that his helmet hid his expression was useless; his stride was controlled and reserved. I could tell from the speed and precision of his strikes that he was brimming with excitement. I took a nimble step back, firmly grasping my weapon while scanning my opponent's movements. I took a few jabs aimed at his blade to test the waters once his attacks let up, but Chris kept his ground; my blade bounced right off. I couldn't help but let out a snigger as I realized his intent was to embarrass me. It became obvious that he was a man who sat on his high horse and liked to showcase his superiority over others. I pivoted my right leg forward, towards his blade, and swung my right arm with all my might. My blade struck his at a speed I never thought possible, at least not during my training. The technique was sloppy at best, since I had never faced a real person before, but it was enough to send him staggering back, this obviously being a first for him. Frustration now brewing up beneath his helmet, he entered his stance again, only to be met with the same nonchalant counter<strong>-</strong>stance as before. He was more weary this time, staying in tight as he launched a series of slashes my way. I stepped back, narrowly avoiding each strike until my back was at the edge of the arena. Not missing a beat, he sent a fierce slash aimed at my neck. I barely managed to drop to my knees for an unorthodox counter-slash, sweeping his feet out from beneath him and snapping the dainty weapon I was wielding in half, its tip launching into the air. Chris tumbled onto his back, the broken half impaling the earth beside him, narrowly avoiding his head.</p> <p>&quot;Ahahaha! Whaddaya know, you ain't half bad, are ya‽ Maybe I was the cocky one after all!&quot; said the burly man, unable to contain his laughter.</p> <p>I discarded the broken blade's handle, exiting the arena and making my way back home without complaint. I realized I had quite some work to do when it came to technique.</p> <hr /> <p>I was ready to set sail. No beast, no matter its size, would have any chance against me. I would make it off of this accursed island, even if it meant my doom.</p> <p>I sat down for one last hearty meal with my uncle; he knew full well of my plans and what I had to do. The cheddar broccoli soup he made was a favourite recipe of mine, so I got him to make it for me one last time. I raised the wooden spoon to my mouth and allowed the strong, cheesy flavour to coat the entirety of my mouth, enjoying a final moment of comfort. I was never destined to stay in this place. Since I was young, I was always fated to find my way out of the pond and into the ocean. My uncle watched me with teary eyes, grinning softly. &quot;I know your brother and father failed before you, but I can't help but believe in you. Something about you feels different from them; I really mean it. Just promise me one thing, alright? Don't leave your ol' uncle behind forever. Come visit me someday.&quot; &quot;Of course I will, and I'll come with souvenirs.” He smiled dearly, tears streaming down his face. I took one more bite from my dish, setting off to conclude the journey that my brother and father had once started many years ago.</p> <hr /> <p>The winds were strong that day, more than usual at least. My ship swayed back and forth as the waves beat against the hull. It wasn't anything grand, but it was built to last, so I put my faith in it. I stood idly at the helm as it floated forward, the coastline behind me becoming less and less visible. I was further out than my brother had made it, that was for certain. A bead of sweat made its way from my temple to my neck, anxiety building by the second. The boat rocked back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, until the rhythm grew stronger; it was now being tossed around in the current. I scanned around. Straight ahead, there was a whirlpool, a massive one at that. I immediately adjusted the sails away from the massive black hole in the ocean that, as far as I knew, reached as far as the ocean floor. It seemed as if it were a void, an abyss of sorts.</p> <p>As I surveyed the hole and distanced myself, another force launched my ship forward, much more abruptly than before. There was a disturbance in the water underneath, and my heart sank as I spotted its familiar fangs. It leapt out from the depths, barrelling towards the top of my ship, and I pulled out my sword in defiance. It glared at me, and I glared back. It gnawed at me, <em>and I gnawed back</em>. I cleaved a clean chunk out of its flesh with two precise sweeps of my blade in an instant, removing one of its fins. The monster passed over my ship and got sucked into the whirlpool behind me. Perhaps I'd learned some useful swordplay from Chris after all. At least 100 pounds of fresh fish meat landed squarely on my vessel; it seems like a well-deserved meal.</p> <hr /> <p>I continued on for days upon days, eating up my rations much quicker than expected. The last of the fish meat was rotten and bitter, and the remainder of my own rations consisted of crackers and wine. Just when I thought lady misfortune had gotten the better of me, I spotted a <em><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-422">series of rafts</a></em> in the distance, and there was movement too. I had finally done it! I'd reached the outside world, and without a hitch too! I gleefully hoisted the sails and let the wind blow me to them, but what was unbeknownst to me was the growing swirl that stalked my every move&#8230;</p> <hr /> <h1><span>TBC&#8230;</span></h1> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/r-a-t-i-f" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8095511&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713001" alt="r a t i f" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8095511)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/r-a-t-i-f" >r a t i f</a></span></p>

&lt;strong&gt;Terror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come with me,” The Beast ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max gazed at the anthropomorphic squid in amazement. He towered over the crowd of M.E.G. operatives and FOJ members like a giant. He was finely dressed in a tuxedo with a cup of tea in his tentacle. The crowd was petrified with fear at the sight. The room turned silent, and the cacophony of the casino behind them remained the only thing audible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors of this monster were common amidst anyone who had been to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5&quot;&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt;. It was thought he was simply a myth, no more real than Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Despite such rumors, however, the creature stood right there in front of them, contorting the front of his head to look like he was smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-18&quot;&gt;The Beast of Level 5&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7&quot;&gt;Jerry&lt;/a&gt; squawked condescendingly. “I should kill you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beast chortled. “Now that would be a bloody good bit of entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No need, Jerry. I’ll do it myself.” Without much hesitation, Father Bluebird unsheathed his sword and lunged forward, sword pointed at the Beast’s heart. The Beast seemed to suddenly disappear right before the sword could even pierce his suit. Father Bluebird looked around in amazement. Despite his elderly age, his speed was unmatched — despite that, this creature seemingly dodged the attack without him even noticing. He felt a firm, sticky tap on his shoulder behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, now. I’m not here to squabble. I am here simply to ask if you-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Beast could even finish his thought, Father Bluebird spun his arm around like a tornado, causing a small gust of wind to hit the others from the weight of his sword swinging in the air. Once again, the Beast had suddenly disappeared. He let out an angry roar, this time predicting his moves. Before the Beast could say anything, Father Bluebird flourished his sword behind him and laughed when he felt the blade stop on something. He spun around, smugly grinning beneath his mask. His visage changed when he realized the Beast was unharmed, grasping the edge of his sword with his other tentacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Almighty Jerry, I have him where I want him! Put him under your control!” Father Bluebird pleaded. Jerry remained silent. He cooed in pain as he ascended from Macy’s shoulder and perched on the swordsman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot defeat him. Yield,” Jerry ordered, seemingly maintaining a look of embarrassment on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the matter? Aren’t you going to turn me into one of your slaves, or — excuse me — Followers?” the Beast taunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why aren’t you doing anything, All-powerful One?!” Father Bluebird pleaded desperately, using all of his might to try to push down the sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said yield,” Jerry ordered firmly. Father bluebird sighed in frustration, but he had no choice. He receded his blade and sheathed it behind him. The Beast laughed and sipped his cup of tea, which amazingly hadn’t spilled even a drop throughout the whole encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the bird fails to mention is that his powers have no effect on me or anyone here. I know how his dirty tricks work, and I will make one thing clear.” The Beast approached Father Bluebird with lightning speed, almost as if he was teleporting, and looked at him directly in the eye. “This is my domain, and I call the shots here. Make no mistake that anyone who steps into this hotel remains alive at my own mercy. If I found myself in a more murderous mood today, you would have been dead before your rotting, elderly brain could even fathom the fact that you were dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father Bluebird stared back at him coldly. It was hard to tell his expression beneath the mask, but he almost looked afraid — extremely unusual for him. Regardless, he tried to maintain a strong posture to uphold his reputation with the other Followers. The old man considered responding to The Beast with a quip or challenge, but he opted to stay silent. Something about The Beast&#039;s dark aura sent chills down his spine that would silence even the bravest of souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My apologies, Mr&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Alex stammered, jumping in to diffuse the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mr. Gentleman is fine.&amp;quot; The Beast replied quickly. She took a deep breath, trying not to let his intimidation get to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Mr. Gentleman. My name is Alex. I&#039;m here with some members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;The M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; and The Followers of Jerry. Their home has been destroyed by an undocumented growing void that seems to eat away at the very reality of levels, leaving behind a darkness that disintegrates anything and everything in its path. We spent weeks trying anything and everything to stop its progression, but nothing seemed to work in any permanent capacity. We were trying to travel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt; for refuge, but we were stopped on &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2&quot;&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt; by another instance of the void. We had no choice but to take an alternative route to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;. I truly apologize for the intrusion and trouble we&#039;ve caused here. If you could just direct us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;, we won&#039;t cause any more trouble here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beast looked at her with a stoic expression. His unique anatomy made it difficult to read his facial expression. His breathing seemed to intensify suddenly as he pondered her words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That means this problem is larger than I ever could have imagined,&amp;quot; he finally responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you noticed an instance of the phenomenon here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A few days ago, I received reports from one of my patrons that my barkeep hadn&#039;t come in for work. I went to the bar to see if something had happened&amp;#8230; but it was gone. In its place was black void. I&#039;ve placed curtains around the area and claimed that we were remodeling the bar, as such a sight is not very good for business. If what you&#039;re saying is true, however, I don&#039;t reckon a curtain will solve the issue for very long, will it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, it won&#039;t. The void will only continue to grow, and none of us know how to stop it. We have to evacuate everyone from the casino and the hotel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt; now. Come on, guys!&amp;quot; Alex beckoned to Max and the rest of the M.E.G. operatives to follow. Luckily, they had landed right in the Beverly Room, so the casino was in mere walking distance. The group ran behind Alex through the large entrance doors. His senses were immediately overwhelmed with intense, flashing lights and the loud sounds of slot machines and other miscellaneous gambling games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, there&#039;s an emergency! This entire place is going to be destroyed, and you need to leave and get to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt; now!&amp;quot; Alex shouted, shaking one of the players. He didn&#039;t seem to notice her warnings and continued to play. She snapped her fingers in front of his face, but he still remained entirely focused on the game. &amp;quot;Sir, if you don&#039;t leave now, you&#039;re going to die!&amp;quot; she screamed. She forcibly turned him around to face her, but she was greeted by a horrible sight. The man had a long beard and looked like he hadn&#039;t shaved in weeks. His eyes were bloodshot and irritated from the lights, and his hands trembled from all of the playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was going to warn you, but you&#039;re a little too eager there, chap. They&#039;re too far gone to be saved or evacuated,&amp;quot; The Beast said grimly. The other operatives looked on in horror as the man groaned in a zombie-like manner and returned to his game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you do to them?&amp;quot; Max asked, disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They did it to themselves. I never force anyone to enter this place. Likewise, they can leave whenever they wish. They simply&amp;#8230; have lost the desire to do so. They poured and prepared the Kool-Aid, so can I really be called the villain for making sure they drink it?&amp;quot; The Beast responded menacingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re sick. No wonder they call you The Beast!&amp;quot; Max exclaimed, losing his temper. Alex glared at him, concerned with angering such a powerful being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can Jerry do anything to reverse it, maybe?&amp;quot; Alex asked, trying to quickly change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beings like him have no power here. These people are gone. This is where they will die, beside myself and my coworkers,&amp;quot; The Beast replied solemnly. &amp;quot;I am unable to leave this place. It is my curse. A captain always goes down with his ship, they say. Unless you can find a way to stop this, the last thing they hear will be the sounds of these slot machines.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Show us where it is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group followed The Beast through the large casino as lights and music blasted throughout the establishment. Max looked around in horror as the patrons stared at the various machines intently, only stopping to sip a drink or shove food into their mouth. Various quirky staff members wandered around serving said refreshments to the customers. They all resembled disproportionate beings that were inspired by various inanimate objects such as an 8-ball or wine glass. Their spotless suits stuck out among the dirty clothes of the customers, which likely hadn&#039;t been washed in months in some cases. Max&#039;s thoughts on The Beast were already quite low, but he didn&#039;t think he could ever forgive something like this. He put himself in their shoes, imagining his body being disintegrated by the atom while he could do nothing but continue to play. It was a grim thought, and he certainly didn&#039;t envy their situation. After a long trek, the group arrived at a large set of curtains covering what used to be the bar. Various signs warning that the bar was under temporary construction and to mind the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful. There&#039;s no telling how much it has grown in the last week or so,&amp;quot; The Beast warned. Alex erected her taser stick and carefully moved aside one of the curtains to reveal the dark void they had grown accustomed to. A shiver went down Alex&#039;s spine as she saw the void again. Something about it seemed to affect her sangfroid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&#039;s it, alright. We found out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4&quot;&gt;Object 4&lt;/a&gt; causes it to recede slightly, but we aren&#039;t sure how long that will last, or if it will even work again. We have one right here that we can give you, but it&#039;s out of batteries. Do you have any laying around?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything and everything you could ever want is right within these walls. Right, then. I thank you for assisting me and my hotel staff in this dilemma. After all, an enemy of one&#039;s enemy is a friend. Hopefully this issue will be resolved from here on out. Once we get the Deuclidator set up, I will escort you to the staircase that leads to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;The Empty Office&lt;/a&gt; in a jiffy. In the meantime, I suggest that your group remain in here to avoid the infestation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4&quot;&gt;Deathmoths&lt;/a&gt; in the lobby. We are still&amp;#8230; trying our best with that issue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great, thanks again,&amp;quot; Alex replied. She sat down at a nearby table with Max and Macy, taking a sigh of relief that The Beast didn&#039;t kill them right away. Sinclair and Father Bluebird informed the group of the situation and organized them near the curtain so that they would be prepared to leave as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max looked at his old friend and partner. While the others appeared hopeful and optimistic, she seemed troubled. &amp;quot;What&#039;s the matter? Aren&#039;t you excited to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sort of. Sinclair told me it was a nice place, aside from the large population of M.E.G. operatives making the FOJ unwelcome, that is. No offense,&amp;quot; Macy replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;None taken. Are you sure you&#039;re okay, though?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is just&amp;#8230; a lot. Ever since we got here, I&#039;ve been expected to come to terms with so many ridiculous things that make no sense. First off, we &amp;quot;noclipped&amp;quot; through the world into some alternate death-maze reality. I&#039;m just expected to understand that as normal&amp;#8230; noclipping like a speedrunner in a video game walking through a wall? Seriously?&amp;quot; Macy responded with an upset tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean, when you put it like that&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then, I become the second in command of a bird cult by pure luck, and I&#039;m expected to be in charge of all of these people. Then said cult&#039;s room gets eaten by some mysterious black void that keeps appearing across all of the other levels. Then, we have to take a detour into a giant casino and enlist the help of a squid-monster to get to a giant city to find a group of people that might know how to fix this?&amp;quot; Max was silent as she vented her frustrations to him. In all the chaos, he had almost forgotten how ridiculous this place was. He didn&#039;t understand why they had to end up here. Regrets overwhelmed him. What if he hadn&#039;t gone in to work that day? What if his other companion, Aaron, went in first? His thoughts were interrupted by Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, kid. I&#039;ve been here longer than you&#039;ve been alive. Time here works really weirdly compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms&quot;&gt;The Frontrooms&lt;/a&gt;. I noclipped a good 60 years ago, and yet I still look like I&#039;m in my twenties. The only reason I&#039;ve survived this long is because of perseverance. This place is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, and it never ceases to amaze me sometimes. You get to a point where you just have to accept that this is all there is now. If you sit here in terror, you&#039;re just gonna end up dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex pulled out a small, heart-shaped necklace hidden beneath her shirt. She opened it to reveal a black-and-white picture of her and a man standing next to each other. She had a smile on her face that Max didn&#039;t recognize: a sense of joy and youthful naïveté that she seemed to have lost. She pulled out a small piece of yellowed paper that was folded up into a small square and unfolded it. It was torn and damaged from age, but the writing was still intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lightblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To my love, Alexandra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&#039;t wait to return from my studying abroad in London to come see you. I have dearly missed America, but more importantly I long to see you again. London is a beautiful place. The architecture of the old kingdom, the palace, Big ben: it&#039;s all indescribably beautiful. It does not, however, compare to the love I hold for you. I&#039;m writing this letter on Friday. In 2 weeks, I will be returning to Chicago for the summer. As soon as I arrive, I want to take you on a date to that pizza place near our home. Will you please make reservations for us? I love you so much, and even though we are seas apart, my love for you only continues to grow. If only it were possible for you to be here with me now. I eagerly await your warm embrace (and that delicious pizza!). See you very soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With love,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;David.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I never saw him again. This was the last I ever heard from him,&amp;quot; Alex whispered solemnly. She held back the pain in her voice, attempting to maintain her serious personality that she was known for. She clenched the paper tightly, as she had done many times before, and folded it back up neatly into the necklace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alex&amp;#8230; you never told m-&amp;quot; Max stuttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because it&#039;s irrelevant,&amp;quot; she boomed, firmly snapping the necklace shut and reconcealing it beneath her shirt. &amp;quot;My point is that what&#039;s happened has happened. You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come. Don&#039;t expect me to always be there to save your sorry butts from trouble and toughen up. This isn&#039;t an ideal situation for any of us, but if we sit here and cry about what could be, we may as well just throw ourselves right into the void now rather than waiting for it to come to us.&amp;quot; Max and Macy were speechless. How could a statement so vulnerable feel like such a lethal pierce to the heart? The tension was quickly broken by The Beast returning to the table with Sinclair, Father Bluebird, and Jerry beside him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right, then. I&#039;ve activated the Deuclidator. It&#039;s currently starting up as we speak next to the bar. Hopefully it will solve this predicament swiftly so we can fully return to business as usual,&amp;quot; The Beast reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Followers and operatives are ready to get moving. What&#039;s got you three all pouty?&amp;quot; Sinclair snarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing. We&#039;re all set to get moving. Thank you again, Mr. Gentleman. Your help was much appreciated. Now then, let&#039;s g-&amp;quot; before Alex could finish her statement, a set of screams suddenly pierced her ears from the other side of the room. She looked over to see the void suddenly growing extremely quickly. Alex&#039;s eyes widened at the sight. Before, it had moved at a rate unnoticeable to the naked eye. Now, it was rapidly approaching them. They watched in horror as The Followers and operatives were mercilessly swallowed by the void as they tried to run away from its sudden progression. Jerry immediately took flight and narrowly avoided the void, soaring for the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Holy crap! Go!&amp;quot; Sinclair screeched, beckoning them to run for the entrance. Without hesitation, they ran as fast as they could as the entire casino began to get swallowed by the rapidly progressing darkness. One by one, Followers and Operatives disappeared into the darkness as they attempted to escape. Various games, machines, and customers fell victim to the darkness as well. Nothing was safe from its insatiable destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You said the Deuclidator would cause it to recede! You lied to me! Look what you&#039;ve done to my casino!&amp;quot; The Beast roared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was telling the truth! When we tested it the first time, it caused the void to recede slightly until it ran out of battery. This shouldn&#039;t be happening!&amp;quot; Father Bluebird exclaimed through huffs and puffs. Despite his incredible agility, his age did not allow him to retain his stamina. He began to lag behind the other six slightly as they inched closer to the entrance. Macy glanced behind her to see that the void had now consumed almost the entire casino. The only part remaining was the entrance lobby. Sinclair reached into her bag of weapons and grabbed her final bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-42&quot;&gt;Black Bottled Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have to throw this at the void. It&#039;s our only hope!&amp;quot; she screamed. The sounds of screaming and running now overpowered the cacophony of casino sounds that once seemed louder than anything they had ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What if it starts going even faster?&amp;quot; Max yelled back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#039;re not gonna make it out in time. We have no choice but to try!&amp;quot; Sinclair cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Throw it at me! I will deflect it off of my sword onto the void. Otherwise, the ensuing damage may result in our deaths either way!&amp;quot; Father Bluebird exclaimed. Sinclair was unsure about his plan, but she had no choice. Any more hesitation, and she would be swallowed. She reached into her bag and revealed a small vial with black sparks of electricity bouncing around the container. Father Bluebird unsheathed his sword and took a deep breath, knowing that failure meant certain death. He clenched the hilt of his sword tightly and locked his gaze on the vial. With all the strength she could muster, Sinclair quickly turned around while continuing to run and tossed the bottle at her fellow Follower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiftly and cleanly, Father Bluebird swung his sword at the bottle while running sideways. The vial deflected off of the blade and rushed for the ground, immediately shattering on impact. Instantly, the lightning began to scatter in many directions, causing it to come into contact with what was left of the broken games and machines. The surge of electricity caused a sudden explosion that sent the survivors flying forward toward the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max landed flat on his face, bracing himself to be disintegrated. After a few moments, he opened his eyes and looked around. His glasses had flown off of his face in the blast, so his surroundings were blurry. He rolled over in pain and looked around; his skin was slightly singed from the explosion. He saw the blurry image of the large lights on the front door of the casino, which proved to him that he had survived. Relieved, he felt around the floor for his glasses. A wave of embarrassment washed over him as he crawled around like Velma, hopelessly feeling for his glasses. He finally found them and placed them back on his face, horrified by what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and Macy were the furthest away from the blast; their police training paid off well. Macy was thankfully conscious, simply in pain from the sudden launch forward. Alex and Sinclair were behind. The backs of both women&#039;s shirts were covered in holes from being slightly burned. Sinclair&#039;s long, greasy black hair was all frizzy and singed in various locations. Like Macy, they were conscious, but in pretty intense pain. Father Bluebird was extremely close to the blast, but most of the impact seemed to have been deflected from his sword. He was in a similar condition to Alex and Sinclair. Max&#039;s heart dropped when he realized that the rest of the Followers, the M.E.G. operatives, and customers of the casino were all unaccounted for. A tear fell from his face as he realized that the majority of his and Macy&#039;s friends were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry flew from high up to Max and perched in front of him. Jerry gazed at the insatiable monster that had run him out of home and killed most of his friends. His normally looming personality seemed notably absent as he gazed into its darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many are left?&amp;quot; Max asked, his throat in pain as he held back bitter weeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;7. You, Macy, Alex, Father Bluebird, Sinclair, The Beast, and I. I&amp;#8230; sense no more life here&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Jerry responded. His voice was monotonous and emotionless. It lacked its usual intimidating, cunning cadence that made his voice so chilling. It was almost robotic. Max watched the void in silence for a moment. Remnants of the black lightning jumped around the void like a violent storm at night. Thankfully, though, it seemed to have ceased its rampage. Sinclair&#039;s plan worked. Max slowly approached Father Bluebird to make sure he was still conscious. He was shocked to see The Beast on the floor right in front of the void. He gasped as he saw that The Beast&#039;s legs were submerged in the darkness. His nice suit was reduced to singed rags. Most of his body was exposed, showing off his severe burns and bloody wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mr. Gentleman!&amp;quot; Max screamed, instinctively kneeling down to help him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot; he commanded weakly. He lifted his head up to look at Max, shaking as he struggled to hold himself up. &amp;quot;The void has been stopped for now, but my legs are inside of it. If you take me out, I will bleed to death.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m so sorry!&amp;quot; Max cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. &amp;quot;Object 4 stopped it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-274&quot;&gt;Jerry&#039;s room&lt;/a&gt; when we tested it out. I don&#039;t understand why it didn&#039;t work here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This void&amp;#8230; this &lt;strong&gt;Decay&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8230; I believe it&#039;s bigger than any of us. I was foolish to think mere humans could stop this&amp;#8230; As I told you before, a captain always goes down with his ship. You simply took away the looming dread of death.&amp;quot; The Beast winced in pain as he took deep, labored breaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What will happen to the hotel?&amp;quot; Max asked. Unable to speak much more, The Beast solemnly looked behind Max, pointing his tentacle in that direction. A feeling of dread washed over Max as he saw a black wall of darkness blocking their way to the staircase to Level 4. He hadn&#039;t realized, but The Decay had grown beyond the walls of the casino and blocked them off from the rest of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your escape is inaccessible. I am sorry,&amp;quot; The Beast wheezed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do we do? Are we stuck here?&amp;quot; Max asked frantically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your only hope is The Boiler Room. It is an extremely dangerous portion of the hotel, but if you can successfully traverse to the end, you will end up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6&quot;&gt;Lights Out&lt;/a&gt;. Under normal conditions, such an area is far too dangerous for anyone to be, but I believe you are beyond the luxury of a choice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;L-Lights Out&amp;#8230; That&#039;s Level 6! We can&#039;t go there! That&#039;s instant death!&amp;quot; Max cried, his heart beating like an engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;d enounter the same fate by staying here. There are heatproof suits by the entrance. I put them there in case the room ever needed to be used as an emergency exit or hiding place. There should be enough for you and your companions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is there nothing we can do for you?&amp;quot; Max asked, afraid of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I shan&#039;t keep the devil waiting any longer than I already have. Go quickly while you still have the chance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;B-But-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll see you in the beyond.&amp;quot; Before Max could say goodbye, The Beast lifted himself one last time into a pushup stance. With all the remaining strength he had left, he pushed his body backwards into the darkness, disappearing inside of it. One of the most powerful beings in The Backrooms was dead. The Beast had been slain. Max looked at the darkness, staring at where The Beast once was as the remnants of the lightning crackled in the background. He covered his face in shock. Alex&#039;s words from moments earlier resonated in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no time to waste. Max helped up his wounded companions to their feet and informed them of The Beast&#039;s final words. They were all burnt, bruised, emotionally wounded, and shivering with fear of Level 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is there really no other way?&amp;quot; Alex asked. She remembered her training to become an M.E.G. operative all that time ago. Back then, she received a list of levels to &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; go to under any circumstances. Level 6 was one of those levels. It was a pitch-black maze with no easy way out. Flashlights and other light sources were useless. The level was so dark that they wouldn&#039;t even be able to see their own hands in front of their faces. There was no guarantee they would survive the undocumented entities, the auditory hallucinations, or the strange anomalies and phenomena. Likewise, it was probable that they would be separated upon entry, as encountering people on Level 6 is generally presumed to be impossible, and she was told to assume that any human contact is a mere hallucination or entity attempting to trick you. On top of all that, there was no guarantee that they wouldn&#039;t walk straight into The Decay, as the darkness would disguise it quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Beast said all other exits have been blocked. No stairs, no elevators, no walls we can noclip through, what else is there to do?&amp;quot; Macy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&#039;s a door inside of The Boiler Room that leads to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-78&quot;&gt;The Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, which we can take to get to The City. Maybe that would be safer?&amp;quot; Sinclair advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And get stranded in space? No. Max is right.&amp;quot; Alex took a deep breath. &amp;quot;We have to go to Level 6.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only hope we have in Lights Out is accidentally tripping over a wire to get to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1&quot;&gt;The Snackrooms&lt;/a&gt;. We&#039;re going on a suicide mission on the hope that we accidentally get to where we need to go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re free to get killed here, or you can follow Max and I and take your chances at the last thread of hope we have left. What will it be?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Almighty Jerry, what is your wisdom? Father Bluebird asked. Jerry&#039;s eyes were wide open, staring intently at nothing. He looked like he had been shell-shocked. His Followers, save for three, had all died. He didn&#039;t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are right. If there&#039;s any hope left, we must pursue it. Go forth into The Boiler Room,&amp;quot; Jerry squawked quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What will you do?&amp;quot; Macy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can travel this realm in ways you cannot. I must separate from you for the time being. I will meet you in The Snackrooms. I&amp;#8230; sincerely hope we don&#039;t lose anyone else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I understand. Please be safe,&amp;quot; Father Bluebird replied. Jerry took flight towards one of the remaining walls and let out a quiet coo in front of it. He suddenly soared towards it and noclipped right through it. He wished he could bring the others with him, but it was unfortunately impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max, Alex, Macy, Sinclair, and Father Bluebird all looked at the large door beside them with a sign over it that said &amp;quot;BOILER ROOM: DO NOT ENTER&amp;quot; in large, red letters. They all braced themselves for what was to come. Alex opened the door carefully, immediately getting greeted by a blast of sweltering heat. The pain from the burns on their skin suddenly doubled in intensity. Father Bluebird and Sinclair could barely move from the pain, so this was quite inconvenient. Their adrenaline was the only thing keeping them going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#039;re so dead&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Sinclair mumbled. Alex peeked her head into the hot room and noticed the heat-proof suits that The Beast mentioned, passing them out to the others. The suits were a metallic-grey color with a black window that served as the faceplate; creepy looking, to say the least. Max was worried about obscuring his vision with a black visor in an already pitch-black environment, but it wouldn&#039;t really make much of a difference positively or negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Before you put these on, I have a bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1&quot;&gt;Green Almond Water&lt;/a&gt;. Open your thermoses and take some of this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Almond Water?! Are you trying to get us killed?!&amp;quot; Sinclair screeched. Alex had almost forgotten how unstable she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair. It&#039;s Jerry&#039;s weakness, not ours. It&#039;s okay,&amp;quot; Macy responded reassuringly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&#039;s this for? A Snack?&amp;quot; Max asked, confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is a special kind of Almond Water that heightens your agility, energy, eliminates drowsiness, and keeps you sharp in the mind: kind of like coffee but slightly stronger. Level 6 is bursting at the seams with hallucination-inducing phenomena. It&#039;s a guarantee you&#039;ll hear and&#039;/or see something that&#039;s not actually there. If you keep sipping on this, it&#039;ll keep that to a minimum. It&#039;s not a cure or end-all-be-all, but it&#039;s something: a safety precaution for whatever&#039;s lying beyond The Boiler Room, if you will.&amp;quot; Sinclair and Father Bluebird scoffed and were quite reluctant to take the offer, but they knew that the hallucinations in this level were lethal at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Alex filled their thermoses, the group zipped up each other&#039;s heat-proof suits and stared into the long, hot corridor before them. With immense terror and reluctance, they entered the room. As they approached the end of the corridor, the heat of The Boiler Room began to overwhelm them. Even with their suits, the heat was so powerful that they could still feel it. They trudged through the thin corridors, carefully contorting around the large machinery to prevent further burns to their bodies. After what seemed like an eternity, they reached a point where the dim overhead lights started flickering. Alex noticed this instantly, her heart dropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#039;ve arrived. Beyond this point, we will not see each other again until we get to 6.1. The level will isolate and separate us, and we&#039;ll be on our own,&amp;quot; Alex stated coldly. Max turned back to Macy and hugged her once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m so glad you were safe here. I&#039;m just happy I at least got to see you one more time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy squeezed back even tighter. &amp;quot;You&#039;re not allowed to go missing again, got it?&amp;quot; Macy chuckled through tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I won&#039;t. Stop being so terrified of the dark, you baby,&amp;quot; Max taunted, also crying. They sat for a minute in silence. The booming sounds of the machinery and boilers were all they could hear. They backed away and faced their fate once more. Max grabbed Alex&#039;s hand as they squeezed next to each other, facing the darkness. They cautiously walked forward into the darkness until the light slowly diminished. They entered the shadows, clutching each other&#039;s hands tightly as they prayed that they wouldn&#039;t run into The Decay. The heat and the sounds of the machines slowly dissipated into silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the feeling of Alex&#039;s hand disappeared. Max checked his surroundings to see if he could find the others, but only saw nothing at all. He felt around for his companions, but there was nothing. He unzipped his mask and took a sip of Alex&#039;s Almond Water, taking a deep breath as he processed the horrifying labyrinth before him. He trudged forward blindly, at the mercy of the void ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

He towered over the crowd of M.E.G. operatives and FOJ members like a giant. He was finely dressed in a tuxedo with a cup of tea in his tentacle. The crowd was petrified with fear at the sight. The room turned silent, and the cacophony of the casino behind them remained the only thing audible.</p> <p>Rumors of this monster were common amidst anyone who had been to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Level 5</a>. It was thought he was simply a myth, no more real than Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Despite such rumors, however, the creature stood right there in front of them, contorting the front of his head to look like he was smiling.</p> <p>“<a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-18">The Beast of Level 5</a>,” <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7">Jerry</a> squawked condescendingly. “I should kill you.”</p> <p>The Beast chortled. “Now that would be a bloody good bit of entertainment.”</p> <p>“No need, Jerry. I’ll do it myself.” Without much hesitation, Father Bluebird unsheathed his sword and lunged forward, sword pointed at the Beast’s heart. The Beast seemed to suddenly disappear right before the sword could even pierce his suit. Father Bluebird looked around in amazement. Despite his elderly age, his speed was unmatched — despite that, this creature seemingly dodged the attack without him even noticing. He felt a firm, sticky tap on his shoulder behind him.</p> <p>“Now, now. I’m not here to squabble. I am here simply to ask if you-”</p> <p>Before the Beast could even finish his thought, Father Bluebird spun his arm around like a tornado, causing a small gust of wind to hit the others from the weight of his sword swinging in the air. Once again, the Beast had suddenly disappeared. He let out an angry roar, this time predicting his moves. Before the Beast could say anything, Father Bluebird flourished his sword behind him and laughed when he felt the blade stop on something. He spun around, smugly grinning beneath his mask. His visage changed when he realized the Beast was unharmed, grasping the edge of his sword with his other tentacle.</p> <p>“Almighty Jerry, I have him where I want him! Put him under your control!” Father Bluebird pleaded. Jerry remained silent. He cooed in pain as he ascended from Macy’s shoulder and perched on the swordsman.</p> <p>“You cannot defeat him. Yield,” Jerry ordered, seemingly maintaining a look of embarrassment on his face.</p> <p>“What’s the matter? Aren’t you going to turn me into one of your slaves, or — excuse me — Followers?” the Beast taunted.</p> <p>“Why aren’t you doing anything, All-powerful One?!” Father Bluebird pleaded desperately, using all of his might to try to push down the sword.</p> <p>“I said yield,” Jerry ordered firmly. Father bluebird sighed in frustration, but he had no choice. He receded his blade and sheathed it behind him. The Beast laughed and sipped his cup of tea, which amazingly hadn’t spilled even a drop throughout the whole encounter.</p> <p>“What the bird fails to mention is that his powers have no effect on me or anyone here. I know how his dirty tricks work, and I will make one thing clear.” The Beast approached Father Bluebird with lightning speed, almost as if he was teleporting, and looked at him directly in the eye. “This is my domain, and I call the shots here. Make no mistake that anyone who steps into this hotel remains alive at my own mercy. If I found myself in a more murderous mood today, you would have been dead before your rotting, elderly brain could even fathom the fact that you were dying.”</p> <p>Father Bluebird stared back at him coldly. It was hard to tell his expression beneath the mask, but he almost looked afraid — extremely unusual for him. Regardless, he tried to maintain a strong posture to uphold his reputation with the other Followers. The old man considered responding to The Beast with a quip or challenge, but he opted to stay silent. Something about The Beast's dark aura sent chills down his spine that would silence even the bravest of souls.</p> <p>&quot;My apologies, Mr&#8230; uh&#8230;&quot; Alex stammered, jumping in to diffuse the situation.</p> <p>&quot;Mr. Gentleman is fine.&quot; The Beast replied quickly. She took a deep breath, trying not to let his intimidation get to her.</p> <p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Gentleman. My name is Alex. I'm here with some members of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> and The Followers of Jerry. Their home has been destroyed by an undocumented growing void that seems to eat away at the very reality of levels, leaving behind a darkness that disintegrates anything and everything in its path. We spent weeks trying anything and everything to stop its progression, but nothing seemed to work in any permanent capacity. We were trying to travel to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a> for refuge, but we were stopped on <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2">Level 2</a> by another instance of the void. We had no choice but to take an alternative route to your <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">hotel</a>. I truly apologize for the intrusion and trouble we've caused here. If you could just direct us to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a> or <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>, we won't cause any more trouble here.&quot;</p> <p>The Beast looked at her with a stoic expression. His unique anatomy made it difficult to read his facial expression. His breathing seemed to intensify suddenly as he pondered her words.</p> <p>&quot;That means this problem is larger than I ever could have imagined,&quot; he finally responded.</p> <p>&quot;Have you noticed an instance of the phenomenon here?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;A few days ago, I received reports from one of my patrons that my barkeep hadn't come in for work. I went to the bar to see if something had happened&#8230; but it was gone. In its place was black void. I've placed curtains around the area and claimed that we were remodeling the bar, as such a sight is not very good for business. If what you're saying is true, however, I don't reckon a curtain will solve the issue for very long, will it?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No, it won't. The void will only continue to grow, and none of us know how to stop it. We have to evacuate everyone from the casino and the hotel to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a> now. Come on, guys!&quot; Alex beckoned to Max and the rest of the M.E.G. operatives to follow. Luckily, they had landed right in the Beverly Room, so the casino was in mere walking distance. The group ran behind Alex through the large entrance doors. His senses were immediately overwhelmed with intense, flashing lights and the loud sounds of slot machines and other miscellaneous gambling games.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, there's an emergency! This entire place is going to be destroyed, and you need to leave and get to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a> now!&quot; Alex shouted, shaking one of the players. He didn't seem to notice her warnings and continued to play. She snapped her fingers in front of his face, but he still remained entirely focused on the game. &quot;Sir, if you don't leave now, you're going to die!&quot; she screamed. She forcibly turned him around to face her, but she was greeted by a horrible sight. The man had a long beard and looked like he hadn't shaved in weeks. His eyes were bloodshot and irritated from the lights, and his hands trembled from all of the playing.</p> <p>&quot;I was going to warn you, but you're a little too eager there, chap. They're too far gone to be saved or evacuated,&quot; The Beast said grimly. The other operatives looked on in horror as the man groaned in a zombie-like manner and returned to his game.</p> <p>&quot;What did you do to them?&quot; Max asked, disturbed.</p> <p>&quot;They did it to themselves. I never force anyone to enter this place. Likewise, they can leave whenever they wish. They simply&#8230; have lost the desire to do so. They poured and prepared the Kool-Aid, so can I really be called the villain for making sure they drink it?&quot; The Beast responded menacingly.</p> <p>&quot;You're sick. No wonder they call you The Beast!&quot; Max exclaimed, losing his temper. Alex glared at him, concerned with angering such a powerful being.</p> <p>&quot;Can Jerry do anything to reverse it, maybe?&quot; Alex asked, trying to quickly change the subject.</p> <p>&quot;Beings like him have no power here. These people are gone. This is where they will die, beside myself and my coworkers,&quot; The Beast replied solemnly. &quot;I am unable to leave this place. It is my curse. A captain always goes down with his ship, they say. Unless you can find a way to stop this, the last thing they hear will be the sounds of these slot machines.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Show us where it is.&quot;</p> <p>The group followed The Beast through the large casino as lights and music blasted throughout the establishment. Max looked around in horror as the patrons stared at the various machines intently, only stopping to sip a drink or shove food into their mouth. Various quirky staff members wandered around serving said refreshments to the customers. They all resembled disproportionate beings that were inspired by various inanimate objects such as an 8-ball or wine glass. Their spotless suits stuck out among the dirty clothes of the customers, which likely hadn't been washed in months in some cases. Max's thoughts on The Beast were already quite low, but he didn't think he could ever forgive something like this. He put himself in their shoes, imagining his body being disintegrated by the atom while he could do nothing but continue to play. It was a grim thought, and he certainly didn't envy their situation. After a long trek, the group arrived at a large set of curtains covering what used to be the bar. Various signs warning that the bar was under temporary construction and to mind the mess.</p> <p>&quot;Be careful. There's no telling how much it has grown in the last week or so,&quot; The Beast warned. Alex erected her taser stick and carefully moved aside one of the curtains to reveal the dark void they had grown accustomed to. A shiver went down Alex's spine as she saw the void again. Something about it seemed to affect her sangfroid.</p> <p>&quot;That's it, alright. We found out that <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4">Object 4</a> causes it to recede slightly, but we aren't sure how long that will last, or if it will even work again. We have one right here that we can give you, but it's out of batteries. Do you have any laying around?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Anything and everything you could ever want is right within these walls. Right, then. I thank you for assisting me and my hotel staff in this dilemma. After all, an enemy of one's enemy is a friend. Hopefully this issue will be resolved from here on out. Once we get the Deuclidator set up, I will escort you to the staircase that leads to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">The Empty Office</a> in a jiffy. In the meantime, I suggest that your group remain in here to avoid the infestation of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4">Deathmoths</a> in the lobby. We are still&#8230; trying our best with that issue.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Great, thanks again,&quot; Alex replied. She sat down at a nearby table with Max and Macy, taking a sigh of relief that The Beast didn't kill them right away. Sinclair and Father Bluebird informed the group of the situation and organized them near the curtain so that they would be prepared to leave as soon as possible.</p> <p>Max looked at his old friend and partner. While the others appeared hopeful and optimistic, she seemed troubled. &quot;What's the matter? Aren't you excited to see <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>?&quot; Max asked.</p> <p>&quot;Sort of. Sinclair told me it was a nice place, aside from the large population of M.E.G. operatives making the FOJ unwelcome, that is. No offense,&quot; Macy replied.</p> <p>&quot;None taken. Are you sure you're okay, though?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;This is just&#8230; a lot. Ever since we got here, I've been expected to come to terms with so many ridiculous things that make no sense. First off, we &quot;noclipped&quot; through the world into some alternate death-maze reality. I'm just expected to understand that as normal&#8230; noclipping like a speedrunner in a video game walking through a wall? Seriously?&quot; Macy responded with an upset tone.</p> <p>&quot;I mean, when you put it like that&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Then, I become the second in command of a bird cult by pure luck, and I'm expected to be in charge of all of these people. Then said cult's room gets eaten by some mysterious black void that keeps appearing across all of the other levels. Then, we have to take a detour into a giant casino and enlist the help of a squid-monster to get to a giant city to find a group of people that might know how to fix this?&quot; Max was silent as she vented her frustrations to him. In all the chaos, he had almost forgotten how ridiculous this place was. He didn't understand why they had to end up here. Regrets overwhelmed him. What if he hadn't gone in to work that day? What if his other companion, Aaron, went in first? His thoughts were interrupted by Alex.</p> <p>&quot;Listen, kid. I've been here longer than you've been alive. Time here works really weirdly compared to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms">The Frontrooms</a>. I noclipped a good 60 years ago, and yet I still look like I'm in my twenties. The only reason I've survived this long is because of perseverance. This place is <em>weird</em>, and it never ceases to amaze me sometimes. You get to a point where you just have to accept that this is all there is now. If you sit here in terror, you're just gonna end up dead.&quot;</p> <p>Alex pulled out a small, heart-shaped necklace hidden beneath her shirt. She opened it to reveal a black-and-white picture of her and a man standing next to each other. She had a smile on her face that Max didn't recognize: a sense of joy and youthful naïveté that she seemed to have lost. She pulled out a small piece of yellowed paper that was folded up into a small square and unfolded it. It was torn and damaged from age, but the writing was still intact.</p> <div class="lightblock"> <p><em>To my love, Alexandra.</em></p> <p><br /></p> <p><em>I can't wait to return from my studying abroad in London to come see you. I have dearly missed America, but more importantly I long to see you again. London is a beautiful place. The architecture of the old kingdom, the palace, Big ben: it's all indescribably beautiful. It does not, however, compare to the love I hold for you. I'm writing this letter on Friday. In 2 weeks, I will be returning to Chicago for the summer. As soon as I arrive, I want to take you on a date to that pizza place near our home. Will you please make reservations for us? I love you so much, and even though we are seas apart, my love for you only continues to grow. If only it were possible for you to be here with me now. I eagerly await your warm embrace (and that delicious pizza!). See you very soon.</em></p> <p><br /></p> <div style="text-align: right;"> <p><em>With love,</em><br /> <em>David.</em></p> </div> </div> <p>&quot;I never saw him again. This was the last I ever heard from him,&quot; Alex whispered solemnly. She held back the pain in her voice, attempting to maintain her serious personality that she was known for. She clenched the paper tightly, as she had done many times before, and folded it back up neatly into the necklace.</p> <p>&quot;Alex&#8230; you never told m-&quot; Max stuttered.</p> <p>&quot;Because it's irrelevant,&quot; she boomed, firmly snapping the necklace shut and reconcealing it beneath her shirt. &quot;My point is that what's happened has happened. You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come. Don't expect me to always be there to save your sorry butts from trouble and toughen up. This isn't an ideal situation for any of us, but if we sit here and cry about what could be, we may as well just throw ourselves right into the void now rather than waiting for it to come to us.&quot; Max and Macy were speechless. How could a statement so vulnerable feel like such a lethal pierce to the heart? The tension was quickly broken by The Beast returning to the table with Sinclair, Father Bluebird, and Jerry beside him.</p> <p>&quot;Right, then. I've activated the Deuclidator. It's currently starting up as we speak next to the bar. Hopefully it will solve this predicament swiftly so we can fully return to business as usual,&quot; The Beast reported.</p> <p>&quot;The Followers and operatives are ready to get moving. What's got you three all pouty?&quot; Sinclair snarked.</p> <p>&quot;Nothing. We're all set to get moving. Thank you again, Mr. Gentleman. Your help was much appreciated. Now then, let's g-&quot; before Alex could finish her statement, a set of screams suddenly pierced her ears from the other side of the room. She looked over to see the void suddenly growing extremely quickly. Alex's eyes widened at the sight. Before, it had moved at a rate unnoticeable to the naked eye. Now, it was rapidly approaching them. They watched in horror as The Followers and operatives were mercilessly swallowed by the void as they tried to run away from its sudden progression. Jerry immediately took flight and narrowly avoided the void, soaring for the entrance.</p> <p>&quot;Holy crap! Go!&quot; Sinclair screeched, beckoning them to run for the entrance. Without hesitation, they ran as fast as they could as the entire casino began to get swallowed by the rapidly progressing darkness. One by one, Followers and Operatives disappeared into the darkness as they attempted to escape. Various games, machines, and customers fell victim to the darkness as well. Nothing was safe from its insatiable destruction.</p> <p>&quot;You said the Deuclidator would cause it to recede! You lied to me! Look what you've done to my casino!&quot; The Beast roared.</p> <p>&quot;She was telling the truth! When we tested it the first time, it caused the void to recede slightly until it ran out of battery. This shouldn't be happening!&quot; Father Bluebird exclaimed through huffs and puffs. Despite his incredible agility, his age did not allow him to retain his stamina. He began to lag behind the other six slightly as they inched closer to the entrance. Macy glanced behind her to see that the void had now consumed almost the entire casino. The only part remaining was the entrance lobby. Sinclair reached into her bag of weapons and grabbed her final bottle of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-42">Black Bottled Lightning</a>.</p> <p>&quot;We have to throw this at the void. It's our only hope!&quot; she screamed. The sounds of screaming and running now overpowered the cacophony of casino sounds that once seemed louder than anything they had ever heard.</p> <p>&quot;What if it starts going even faster?&quot; Max yelled back.</p> <p>&quot;We're not gonna make it out in time. We have no choice but to try!&quot; Sinclair cried.</p> <p>&quot;Throw it at me! I will deflect it off of my sword onto the void. Otherwise, the ensuing damage may result in our deaths either way!&quot; Father Bluebird exclaimed. Sinclair was unsure about his plan, but she had no choice. Any more hesitation, and she would be swallowed. She reached into her bag and revealed a small vial with black sparks of electricity bouncing around the container. Father Bluebird unsheathed his sword and took a deep breath, knowing that failure meant certain death. He clenched the hilt of his sword tightly and locked his gaze on the vial. With all the strength she could muster, Sinclair quickly turned around while continuing to run and tossed the bottle at her fellow Follower.</p> <p>Swiftly and cleanly, Father Bluebird swung his sword at the bottle while running sideways. The vial deflected off of the blade and rushed for the ground, immediately shattering on impact. Instantly, the lightning began to scatter in many directions, causing it to come into contact with what was left of the broken games and machines. The surge of electricity caused a sudden explosion that sent the survivors flying forward toward the entrance.</p> <p>Max landed flat on his face, bracing himself to be disintegrated. After a few moments, he opened his eyes and looked around. His glasses had flown off of his face in the blast, so his surroundings were blurry. He rolled over in pain and looked around; his skin was slightly singed from the explosion. He saw the blurry image of the large lights on the front door of the casino, which proved to him that he had survived. Relieved, he felt around the floor for his glasses. A wave of embarrassment washed over him as he crawled around like Velma, hopelessly feeling for his glasses. He finally found them and placed them back on his face, horrified by what he saw.</p> <p>He and Macy were the furthest away from the blast; their police training paid off well. Macy was thankfully conscious, simply in pain from the sudden launch forward. Alex and Sinclair were behind. The backs of both women's shirts were covered in holes from being slightly burned. Sinclair's long, greasy black hair was all frizzy and singed in various locations. Like Macy, they were conscious, but in pretty intense pain. Father Bluebird was extremely close to the blast, but most of the impact seemed to have been deflected from his sword. He was in a similar condition to Alex and Sinclair. Max's heart dropped when he realized that the rest of the Followers, the M.E.G. operatives, and customers of the casino were all unaccounted for. A tear fell from his face as he realized that the majority of his and Macy's friends were gone.</p> <p>Jerry flew from high up to Max and perched in front of him. Jerry gazed at the insatiable monster that had run him out of home and killed most of his friends. His normally looming personality seemed notably absent as he gazed into its darkness.</p> <p>&quot;How many are left?&quot; Max asked, his throat in pain as he held back bitter weeping.</p> <p>&quot;7. You, Macy, Alex, Father Bluebird, Sinclair, The Beast, and I. I&#8230; sense no more life here&#8230;&quot; Jerry responded. His voice was monotonous and emotionless. It lacked its usual intimidating, cunning cadence that made his voice so chilling. It was almost robotic. Max watched the void in silence for a moment. Remnants of the black lightning jumped around the void like a violent storm at night. Thankfully, though, it seemed to have ceased its rampage. Sinclair's plan worked. Max slowly approached Father Bluebird to make sure he was still conscious. He was shocked to see The Beast on the floor right in front of the void. He gasped as he saw that The Beast's legs were submerged in the darkness. His nice suit was reduced to singed rags. Most of his body was exposed, showing off his severe burns and bloody wounds.</p> <p>&quot;Mr. Gentleman!&quot; Max screamed, instinctively kneeling down to help him out.</p> <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; he commanded weakly. He lifted his head up to look at Max, shaking as he struggled to hold himself up. &quot;The void has been stopped for now, but my legs are inside of it. If you take me out, I will bleed to death.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'm so sorry!&quot; Max cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. &quot;Object 4 stopped it in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-274">Jerry's room</a> when we tested it out. I don't understand why it didn't work here!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;This void&#8230; this <strong>Decay</strong>&#8230; I believe it's bigger than any of us. I was foolish to think mere humans could stop this&#8230; As I told you before, a captain always goes down with his ship. You simply took away the looming dread of death.&quot; The Beast winced in pain as he took deep, labored breaths.</p> <p>&quot;What will happen to the hotel?&quot; Max asked. Unable to speak much more, The Beast solemnly looked behind Max, pointing his tentacle in that direction. A feeling of dread washed over Max as he saw a black wall of darkness blocking their way to the staircase to Level 4. He hadn't realized, but The Decay had grown beyond the walls of the casino and blocked them off from the rest of the hotel.</p> <p>&quot;Your escape is inaccessible. I am sorry,&quot; The Beast wheezed.</p> <p>&quot;What do we do? Are we stuck here?&quot; Max asked frantically.</p> <p>&quot;Your only hope is The Boiler Room. It is an extremely dangerous portion of the hotel, but if you can successfully traverse to the end, you will end up in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6">Lights Out</a>. Under normal conditions, such an area is far too dangerous for anyone to be, but I believe you are beyond the luxury of a choice.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;L-Lights Out&#8230; That's Level 6! We can't go there! That's instant death!&quot; Max cried, his heart beating like an engine.</p> <p>&quot;You'd enounter the same fate by staying here. There are heatproof suits by the entrance. I put them there in case the room ever needed to be used as an emergency exit or hiding place. There should be enough for you and your companions.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Is there nothing we can do for you?&quot; Max asked, afraid of what was to come.</p> <p>&quot;I shan't keep the devil waiting any longer than I already have. Go quickly while you still have the chance.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;B-But-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'll see you in the beyond.&quot; Before Max could say goodbye, The Beast lifted himself one last time into a pushup stance. With all the remaining strength he had left, he pushed his body backwards into the darkness, disappearing inside of it. One of the most powerful beings in The Backrooms was dead. The Beast had been slain. Max looked at the darkness, staring at where The Beast once was as the remnants of the lightning crackled in the background. He covered his face in shock. Alex's words from moments earlier resonated in his mind.</p> <p><em>You can either sit here and sulk about it and get yourself killed or roll with the punches as they come.</em></p> <p>There was no time to waste. Max helped up his wounded companions to their feet and informed them of The Beast's final words. They were all burnt, bruised, emotionally wounded, and shivering with fear of Level 6.</p> <p>&quot;Is there really no other way?&quot; Alex asked. She remembered her training to become an M.E.G. operative all that time ago. Back then, she received a list of levels to <strong>never</strong> go to under any circumstances. Level 6 was one of those levels. It was a pitch-black maze with no easy way out. Flashlights and other light sources were useless. The level was so dark that they wouldn't even be able to see their own hands in front of their faces. There was no guarantee they would survive the undocumented entities, the auditory hallucinations, or the strange anomalies and phenomena. Likewise, it was probable that they would be separated upon entry, as encountering people on Level 6 is generally presumed to be impossible, and she was told to assume that any human contact is a mere hallucination or entity attempting to trick you. On top of all that, there was no guarantee that they wouldn't walk straight into The Decay, as the darkness would disguise it quite well.</p> <p>&quot;The Beast said all other exits have been blocked. No stairs, no elevators, no walls we can noclip through, what else is there to do?&quot; Macy asked.</p> <p>&quot;There's a door inside of The Boiler Room that leads to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-78">The Space Station</a>, which we can take to get to The City. Maybe that would be safer?&quot; Sinclair advised.</p> <p>&quot;And get stranded in space? No. Max is right.&quot; Alex took a deep breath. &quot;We have to go to Level 6.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The only hope we have in Lights Out is accidentally tripping over a wire to get to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">The Snackrooms</a>. We're going on a suicide mission on the hope that we accidentally get to where we need to go!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You're free to get killed here, or you can follow Max and I and take your chances at the last thread of hope we have left. What will it be?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;Almighty Jerry, what is your wisdom? Father Bluebird asked. Jerry's eyes were wide open, staring intently at nothing. He looked like he had been shell-shocked. His Followers, save for three, had all died. He didn't know what to say.</p> <p>&quot;They are right. If there's any hope left, we must pursue it. Go forth into The Boiler Room,&quot; Jerry squawked quietly.</p> <p>&quot;What will you do?&quot; Macy asked.</p> <p>&quot;I can travel this realm in ways you cannot. I must separate from you for the time being. I will meet you in The Snackrooms. I&#8230; sincerely hope we don't lose anyone else.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I understand. Please be safe,&quot; Father Bluebird replied. Jerry took flight towards one of the remaining walls and let out a quiet coo in front of it. He suddenly soared towards it and noclipped right through it. He wished he could bring the others with him, but it was unfortunately impossible.</p> <p>Max, Alex, Macy, Sinclair, and Father Bluebird all looked at the large door beside them with a sign over it that said &quot;BOILER ROOM: DO NOT ENTER&quot; in large, red letters. They all braced themselves for what was to come. Alex opened the door carefully, immediately getting greeted by a blast of sweltering heat. The pain from the burns on their skin suddenly doubled in intensity. Father Bluebird and Sinclair could barely move from the pain, so this was quite inconvenient. Their adrenaline was the only thing keeping them going.</p> <p>&quot;We're so dead&#8230;&quot; Sinclair mumbled. Alex peeked her head into the hot room and noticed the heat-proof suits that The Beast mentioned, passing them out to the others. The suits were a metallic-grey color with a black window that served as the faceplate; creepy looking, to say the least. Max was worried about obscuring his vision with a black visor in an already pitch-black environment, but it wouldn't really make much of a difference positively or negatively.</p> <p>&quot;Before you put these on, I have a bottle of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1">Green Almond Water</a>. Open your thermoses and take some of this.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Almond Water?! Are you trying to get us killed?!&quot; Sinclair screeched. Alex had almost forgotten how unstable she was.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair. It's Jerry's weakness, not ours. It's okay,&quot; Macy responded reassuringly.</p> <p>&quot;What's this for? A Snack?&quot; Max asked, confused.</p> <p>&quot;This is a special kind of Almond Water that heightens your agility, energy, eliminates drowsiness, and keeps you sharp in the mind: kind of like coffee but slightly stronger. Level 6 is bursting at the seams with hallucination-inducing phenomena. It's a guarantee you'll hear and'/or see something that's not actually there. If you keep sipping on this, it'll keep that to a minimum. It's not a cure or end-all-be-all, but it's something: a safety precaution for whatever's lying beyond The Boiler Room, if you will.&quot; Sinclair and Father Bluebird scoffed and were quite reluctant to take the offer, but they knew that the hallucinations in this level were lethal at times.</p> <p>After Alex filled their thermoses, the group zipped up each other's heat-proof suits and stared into the long, hot corridor before them. With immense terror and reluctance, they entered the room. As they approached the end of the corridor, the heat of The Boiler Room began to overwhelm them. Even with their suits, the heat was so powerful that they could still feel it. They trudged through the thin corridors, carefully contorting around the large machinery to prevent further burns to their bodies. After what seemed like an eternity, they reached a point where the dim overhead lights started flickering. Alex noticed this instantly, her heart dropping.</p> <p>&quot;We've arrived. Beyond this point, we will not see each other again until we get to 6.1. The level will isolate and separate us, and we'll be on our own,&quot; Alex stated coldly. Max turned back to Macy and hugged her once more.</p> <p>&quot;I'm so glad you were safe here. I'm just happy I at least got to see you one more time.&quot;</p> <p>Macy squeezed back even tighter. &quot;You're not allowed to go missing again, got it?&quot; Macy chuckled through tears.</p> <p>&quot;I won't. Stop being so terrified of the dark, you baby,&quot; Max taunted, also crying. They sat for a minute in silence. The booming sounds of the machinery and boilers were all they could hear. They backed away and faced their fate once more. Max grabbed Alex's hand as they squeezed next to each other, facing the darkness. They cautiously walked forward into the darkness until the light slowly diminished. They entered the shadows, clutching each other's hands tightly as they prayed that they wouldn't run into The Decay. The heat and the sounds of the machines slowly dissipated into silence.</p> <p>Suddenly, the feeling of Alex's hand disappeared. Max checked his surroundings to see if he could find the others, but only saw nothing at all. He felt around for his companions, but there was nothing. He unzipped his mask and took a sip of Alex's Almond Water, taking a deep breath as he processed the horrifying labyrinth before him. He trudged forward blindly, at the mercy of the void ahead.</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="font: 1.5rem 'Mate SC'"> <p><strong>The Broken City will continue in Chapter 5</strong></p> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/meggies">Meggies</a> | <strong>Terror</strong> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/good-intentions">Good Intentions</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713001" alt="Natedagreat563" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" >Natedagreat563</a></span></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&#039;s note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a continuation of a long dormant tale series from 2 years ago, which is a part of a long dormant canon that I&#039;m doing for my enjoyment. It&#039;s unlikely you&#039;ve read the first 2 parts, so please go ahead and check those out first! This is part 3, so it won’t make any sense if you haven’t read parts &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/city-boy&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/macy&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;m really just doing this for me, so I don&#039;t care if this gets a ton of traction or not, but if you&#039;re super interested I would appreciate you read the series. Scroll down to the bottom if you wanna find it or get refreshed on what happened, as I have a directory of all the parts down there. I hold this story dear to my heart and miss writing it, so enjoy it if you&#039;re interested, if not, it&#039;s whatever. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max stared at her, unable to comprehend what was happening. His felt his throat close up, a sharp pain rushing through his neck as the cogs spun wildly in his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Macy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman had lowered her hood, the gilded blue facade falling to reveal short-shaven hair and dark eyes that widened at him in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max…” she whispered. The pair stood silently, eyeing one another in utter disbelief for what seemed like an eternity. Max could feel his eyes begin to water. A tear trickled down his cheek as he recognized the familiar voice of the friend he thought he had lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all at once, Max found himself sprinting forward, enveloping Macy in a tight hug. He buried his face into her left shoulder, earning a disapproving squawk from the blue macaw perched on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought you were dead!&amp;quot; Macy stammered through tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; were dead!&amp;quot; Max choked out a laugh, still locked in his old partner’s warm embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;MAX! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;STOP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex charged forward, shoving Max violently away from the woman in blue. He stumbled backward, colliding into the wall with a loud thud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?!&amp;quot; Max roared. He watched as the other operatives around him drew their clubs, crossbows, and tasers, pointing them all directly at Macy. Behind her, the Followers too poised themselves, their glinting blades pulled from their sheaths and held at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grabbing Max’s shirt, Alex pinned him against the wall, and unslung her backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hold still!&amp;quot; Alex ordered. Unzipping her bag, she whipped out a small thermos flask. Twisting off the cap in a single, swift motion, she forced his mouth open, sloshing half its contents haphazardly over his face and down his throat. Lifting back her head, she proceeded to down several gulps of liquid herself. Max spluttered as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1&quot;&gt;Almond Water&lt;/a&gt; soaked his face and shirt, revolted by the wretched taste of the foul fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?! I haven&#039;t seen her in months!” He yelled through coughs, still choking. “Why did you-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max, are you &lt;em&gt;blind&lt;/em&gt;?! Do you have any idea what the &lt;em&gt;monster&lt;/em&gt; is that’s sitting on her shoulder?!&amp;quot; Alex interrupted, her voice raised in fury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max turned back to Macy. The parrot on her shoulder cocked its head and lifted its beak, almost like it was smiling. It winked at them, as if in reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s just a stupid bird!&amp;quot; The Followers gasped at the bold statement, raising their blades in outrage. Reflexively, the M.E.G. operatives too pointed their weapons forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex sighed in exasperation at her partner&#039;s ignorance. She turned to the captive held among her compatriots, who was grinning gleefully at the mayhem, dark ink dripping from her lips onto the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair! You didn&#039;t tell me &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7&quot;&gt;Jerry&lt;/a&gt; was going to be here!&amp;quot; Alex screamed venomously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max&#039;s eyes widened as he realized that this was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Jerry he had heard about. Innocuous as the bird appeared, the nefarious avian held within his talons the power to put any living mind under his full and total control. The megalomaniac, so he’d heard, would corral all of his victims into the cage of a violently unhinged and despotic cult — with Macy, apparently, as its most recent victim. The bird on her shoulder fixed its gaze upon him, its yellow eyes glinting with haughty mischief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his mind connected the dots, Max felt his chest tighten. His breathing sped up in a panicked manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I apologize for interrupting, but it seems that the rumors you Meggies like to spread have tainted my reputation. Why don&#039;t we all just calm down for a moment?&amp;quot; Jerry flew off of Macy&#039;s shoulder, settling onto one of the room&#039;s many perches, right next to Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He regretted this almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instinctively, Alex let our a shrill cry, flinging what remained of the Almond Water in the thermos onto the bird without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry screeched in immense pain as the liquid soaked into his feathers. Falling off his perch, he landed on the floor next to Max, and began to seize with excruciating spasms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&amp;quot; Sinclair howled. She rushed forward, soothing her master in her shaking hands as he writhed in agony. Behind her, the cultists erupted into a cacophonous outcry and rushed forward, blades waving wildly in the air. Hurriedly, Macy turned to halt them, her arms raised in a vain attempt to pacify their anguished clamor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was taken aback. She’d had no idea that “taming” Jerry would cause him this much pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alex-&amp;quot; Max muttered urgently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the seething mob, Father Bluebird lunged at Alex with with an inhuman ferocity, sword raised in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, the room then exploded into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operatives and the Followers charged, colliding at the center of the room in a flurry of sticks and blades. With lighting speed, Alex drew her trusty taser stick from her side and just barely parried the cruel slash of Father Bluebird’s blade. She sprung into action, retaliating with a powerful backhand swing that forced the cultist backward. As they traded blows, two or three other agents drew their own weapons, sprinting over to defend her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under ordinary circumstances, defeating an expert swordsman like this alone in combat would have been near impossible, even with backup. This time, however, Alex had an advantage. Between her thrusts and strikes, she noticed the weakness of Father Bluebird’s blows — how easily they gave, and how with each strike and parry he had been slowly backed toward the center of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man swung his blade forward again, aiming straight for her jugular, and she parried. Their weapons connected in a deadlock, electric bolts arcing dangerously from her stick onto her opponent’s lustrous blade. He panted hard, eyes blazing with murderous intent beneath his mask. Despite his size and strength, he was struggling, his weapon shaking and nearly buckling as Alex pushed back against it with her club. She glanced at his hilt, desperately looking for a way to escape the bind, and found — oddly enough — that he was holding his weapon one-handed, his stance similar to a traditional fencer. Her keen eyes darted over to his other arm, and quickly found the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His other hand had been amputated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a surge of confidence, Alex sprung forward and got out of the bind, clocking a few more vicious strikes against the Father’s blade before finally disarming the man, the sword flying from his grip like a throwing star and lodging itself in a nearby wall. She held her stick near his neck, the loose bolts of electricity singing his skin. Turning toward her fellow agents, she blew off a stray hair that had fallen across her face and glared at them with a cocky, triumphant visage, relishing in her solo victory against the notorious criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ENOUGH!&amp;quot; Macy screamed. At the word of their anointed one, the cultists froze, ceasing abruptly in their assault. The conflict dissipated as quickly as it had begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidestepping the bruised and battered combatants, Macy strode over to Sinclair, still cradling the unconscious Jerry. All around the room, eyes hung on her in anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stared down at the defeated bird, considering if she should just grab Max and run away from all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macaw’s feathers twitched weakly, its wicked claws grasping faintly at the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought about it long and hard, glancing at Max, who seemed flustered from the recent quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this might be the perfect opportunity for an escape. On the other… where would she even go? Would the ‘Meggies&#039; even take her in after her involvement with the cult? And was it really worth the risk of Jerry waking up and sending a witch hunt after her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She let the idea slide, fear lingering unpleasantly in her mind. Ar the very least, Jerry hadn’t been keen on the conflict. Perhaps rousing him and getting two feuding parties to cooperate would be the best option for now. Bending down, she stroked the bird’s small head, attempting to wake him up. The bird stirred, vacant eyes staring up at Mach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Almighty Jerry?&amp;quot; Sinclair muttered softly. Jerry said nothing. Like an ordinary parrot, he cooed quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jerry, you&#039;re ugly,&amp;quot; Max taunted put of nowhere. The Followers gasped, but their shock quickly turned to Jerry as he continued to stare blankly, making no response to his remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woah… nothing! Alex, whatever you did, I think you turned its brain off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching for his sword, Father Bluebird recovered from his place on the ground and loomed over to Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mere look could kill, Alex would have died on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Under normal circumstances, I would&#039;ve either impaled or beheaded you, maybe even both; but you can see that I&#039;m currently missing something,&amp;quot; he said waving his hand-less arm. &amp;quot;So all I&#039;m going to ask you to do is to &lt;strong&gt;get out&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Way ahead of you. You freaks can deal with your own issues.&amp;quot; Alex opened the front door into Level 0, beckoning Max and the other operatives to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait!&amp;quot; Macy cried desperately. She stretched her hand out toward the agents, who had already begun to file out the door. Alex glanced backward at them, raising an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know this has been rough, but I’ve seen what that void can do. It&#039;s growing bigger by the day, and we can&#039;t just ignore it until it consumes our whole room. Please, help us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex stared back at her coldly, eyeing her blue robes with disdain. She opened her mouth to deny her request and continue out the door. Before she did so, however, she turned to Max, who nudged her with pathetic pleading eyes. Alex had no clue how they knew each other, but it was clear that he didn’t want to leave his friend behind again. She sighed, still infuriated by Sinclair’s treacherous deceit. Yet, as much as she hated to admit it, her sympathy for her friend outmatched the hate she had for the FOJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where is it?&amp;quot; she muttered reluctantly, motioning her fellow operatives back through the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy heaved a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair, Father Bluebird, watch Jerry in case he wakes up,” Macy ordered. “I&#039;ll show them the void.&amp;quot; She beckoned Max, Alex, and the other agents forward, and they followed her into the hallways of the lounge. As they rounded the corner, the sight that greeted them left them all in shock. The void had, by now, extended halfway into the room, couches sticking bizarrely out of the inky black wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh goodness. This doesn&#039;t look good,&amp;quot; Max said in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yep, and it&#039;s growing. A few weeks ago it had pretty much just replaced the back wall. Now, half the room is gone. Sinclair was the first to notice the movement, but we all just thought she was having another episode. Now, we’re kinda starting to realize this is actually a problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ve never seen anything like this. When did it start?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I first got here, Sinclair was bringing Jerry, Father Bluebird, and a couple more of our guys to take a look at it. I&#039;m assuming it must&#039;ve started right around then. As for &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it started, Sinclair still thinks you M.E.G. agents did this. Do you know anything about that?&amp;quot; Macy shot Alex a worried look, secretly hoping she had an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I don&#039;t have all-access credentials, so there&#039;s always the possibility that the higher-ups accidentally did something and tried to cover it up. But personally, I&#039;ve heard nothing about a growing, black void.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you try touching it, or throwing something into it?&amp;quot; Max asked curiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do you think Father Bluebird lost his hand? Whatever goes in, doesn&#039;t come back out,&amp;quot; Macy replied. She grabbed one of Jerry&#039;s golden perches, and poked the end of it into the void. As she pulled it back out, the portion which had made contact with the void was gone. The agents gasped to see that the metal had been sliced like butter in only a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; bad.&amp;quot; Max rubbed the newly flattened end of the perch in surprise. He half-expected it to be warm like it had melted off, or cold after being in pure void, but it was simply… nothing. It was a clean, sharp break, smooth to the point of being wholly unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We should report this. This is really bad,&amp;quot; one of the other agents chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think we could find Base Gamma on &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3&quot;&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt;? We might be able to portal there through the front door. I&#039;ve seen Sinclair do that a few times,&amp;quot; Macy suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No no no. We can&#039;t file an official report yet. If they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; trying to cover something up, and we flag this off as a third-party, we could get involved in something… and trust me, it will not be pretty. And even if it turns out there they are actually clueless about it, the underseers are gonna stick their noses all into this and declare your room a deadzone or something. Verne and his prying research staff will be crawling all over this in a matter of minutes, putting all of you guys out of a home. For now, we need to see if we can figure this out ourselves.&amp;quot; Max replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lovely. Now we’re gonna have to hunker down in this madhouse.” Alex groaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll go prepare a room for each of you,” Macy replied. Sinclair and Father Bluebird would hardly be pleased with the offer, but with Jerry floored, they’d be forced to respect her as their superior. Being the “anointed one” came with privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operatives strode back into the main room where most of the Followers remained, huddling over their dumbed-down master. Sinclair walked up to the two, a tad more calm than usual. Her long, greasy hair waved behind her as she approached them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey guys, so uh… no hard feelings about the whole Snackrooms rampage.” She rubbed her arm sheepishly. “You guys are either really clueless or really good actors. I’ve been studying this void thing for weeks and I don’t&amp;nbsp;get it. There’s nothing on your database about it, no books, no people who know about it, nothing. It just appeared. My bad…” Sinclair gave them a concerned look, seeming genuine for once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry about it. As much as I hate having a knife inches away from being plunged into my neck, I’ve pretty much gotten used to it. Cop training is brutal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, so you’re a cop too? Just like Macy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At this point ‘was’ is probably the better word. I’ve kinda come to terms with the fact that I’m not getting out of here.” Max shrugged. “So, if I may ask, how did Macy become, like…” Max shifted uncomfortably, struggling to find the right words, “…your, uh… leader?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She just showed up out of the blue. Father Bluebird found her hiding behind the couch. She would’ve died if Jerry didn’t stop him from slicing her neck open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max’s heart dropped. A chill went up his spine as he imagined the thought of Macy dying. If things had transpired differently, he probably wouldn’t have ever even known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Geez.” He rubbed his temples. The exhaustion from the whole ordeal was just beginning to set in. Sinclair motioned for Max to follow strolling onto a nearby couch. The two of them flopped down, watching the agents and cultists alike streaming busily by. Alex had wandered off somewhere, probably bossing the operatives with some trivial detail or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so when Macy showed up… that was around the time you guys found the… void?” Max continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. After she was anointed the Chosen One, I started performing extensive performing tests on the void with what few resources we had for this kind of thing. Hopefully you guys will have better luck with all your fancy, newfangled junk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the plan. Macy’s preparing a few rooms for us right now so we can stay for a few days. You interested in helping?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair folded her arms, and leaned back against the sofa placidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As much as I’d love to say no, it’s for the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright then. I’d say we take 5 for today, and then take a crack at it tomorrow.” Max sighed. “It was a long way down here, and I&#039;m beat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void Experiment #1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-15&quot;&gt;Firesalt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is Max Blackfield writing. Our first experiment — throwing a whole pound of Firesalt into the void — was a failure. Half of the explosion went right through the void, while the other half heavily damaged the room. We waited for a day to see if the rate of the void’s growth would slow down or speed up, but we didn’t notice any differences. Sinclair was able to figure out that the void moves between 10-50cm per day. The rate didn’t seem to change at all after we measured using the length of what was left of the room. For the next experiment, we’re going to go a little more heavy duty and attempt to throw a deuclidator at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oldpaper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void Experiment #2: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4&quot;&gt;Deuclidator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next experiment was putting a deuclidator right in front of the void. This experiment yielded more interesting results than the prior. Upon activation, the void actually &lt;em&gt;receded&lt;/em&gt; slightly. It revealed parts of what it had consumed, except for the fact that they were turned into black and crispy husks of what they used to be. We left it on for the entire day, which seemed to work initially, but after it ran out of battery, the void to move again as normal. This may be important to stopping this. Tomorrow, we’re going to try liquid pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oldpaper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void Experiment #3: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-48&quot;&gt;Liquid Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we attempted to splash the void with a whole bottle of liquid pain. Our intention was to see if this would cause a reaction, possibly proving if the void is alive. I know that doesn’t sound likely, but… you can never be too sure with The Backrooms, I suppose. The liquid pain didn’t seem to have any effect on the void, just swallowing it up like any other old object. We’re going to perform another sentience test in a second with a Scaraback. I’ll put it on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oldpaper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void Experiment #4: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-14&quot;&gt;Scaraback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most interesting result we’ve had so far. Alex was holding the Scaraback just in front of the void. Upon activation, she began to hear a loud, piercing scream in her ear. The screaming didn’t stop until I intervened and deactivated the Scaraback. We tried this again, this time with Sinclair as the holder, but this time it had no noticeable effects whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow’s experiment is likely going to be the most dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oldpaper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Void Experiment #5: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-42&quot;&gt;Black Bottled Lightning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment took a few days due to the major safety precautions we had to take. This stuff is incredibly dangerous. Once we made sure everyone was out of the way, I went in with a full hazmat suit and opened a bottle of Black Lightning in front of the void. The lightning shot out quickly and spread all over the wall of black void, zapping and crackling as it did went. This lasted for a few minutes before it eventually burnt out. For three whole days, the void didn’t seem to move at all, remaining dormant. Electrical charges in the air were also unnaturally high in close proximity to the void. It’s the fourth day now, the void has just begun moving again at its normal rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey Max, are you done documenting the lightning experiment?” Alex asked. Max sat next to her on a couch in the main room scribbling furiously into his notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yep, just finished. So, it looks like the Deuclidators and Bottled lightning can stop the void from moving, Firesalt and Liquid Pain had no effect, and the Scaraback has only made us question even more if the thing is alive. Overall, it’s a net gain I’d say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s great. Though, I did wanna discuss something with you in private,” Alex replied. Max looked up from his notebook quizzically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m starting to have second thoughts about this whole ‘not telling the rest of the M.E.G.’ thing I was saying the other day.” Alex leaned in, speaking in a hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the two weeks it took us to perform those experiments, the void has almost consumed the entire room now. At this rate, the entirety of Jerry’s room will probably be consumed in a few months months. This may sound a little drastic, but I’m beginning to think we may need to evacuate these guys to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;.” Alex glanced furtively behind her, hoping that nobody was eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure? I mean, loads of folks in the FOJ are considered armed and dangerous by the higher-ups, there’s a chance some of them could even get killed just for stepping foot into M.E.G. dominant territory, especially if we pass through 6.1 first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, yes, I’m aware. As much as I hate them, though, they’re still just Jerry’s victims, and we can’t leave them here to die. At least they’ve got a shot if they come with us. One way or another, letting them stay is cruel. For all we know, this thing might just be waiting to pounce. Any day now, it might just speed through the room and kill us all before we can even blink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair turned to peek at the inky black wall just down the corridor. It was visible from where they were sitting now, though it hadn’t been just a few days ago. The thing continued to creep forward, encroaching upon the room at an imperceptibly slow pace, its unbroken darkness consuming the walls and floor ever so slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t stay here much longer.” Alex’s voice carried a rightful note of urgency. “The best thing to do may just be to relay this information to one of the higher-ups and possibly work on building a machine to stop it. If we can talk to the Backrooms Robotics… maybe they could design a cannon that shoots bottled lightning every few days… or some kind of massive Deuclidation-field generator or something. We may actually be able to contain this within Jerry’s room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max chewed on the end of his pen, contemplating her words. A chill ran down his spine as he imagined the void appearing out of nowhere in front of him, swallowing him whole in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re right. We need to evacuate. We’ll have to talk to Macy about this — she’s the most reasonable one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No need, I heard all of it.” Macy stepped in through the front door, revealing her presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where were you?” Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On a quick run to The Electrical Station to grab some supplies. As you pointed out, Followers are less welcome in places like The City, so we tend to stick to The Empty Office or The Electrical Station for our groceries and supplies. So, you’re thinking we need to evacuate this place?” Macy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, you heard us, didn’t you? The void is unpredictable. For all we know, it could randomly decide to show up on this side of the wall and corner us until we get consumed by it,” Max reached behind him to tap on the wall behind him with his knuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I-I just…” Macy stammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, I understand your little bird cult is important to you, but your lives are far more valuable than… this.” Alex waved her arms around the room. “If you all want to stay here and die, be my guest, but I can guarantee you that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; won’t be sticking around much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy pondered for a moment before replying, soaking in Alex’s words. “Give me some time to think. I’ll let you know within a few hours. I’m going to go see if Jerry well enough to talk, as much as I don’t like being alone with him.” Macy sighed, and walked past them and into the a hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy opened the door to her room to see a tired-looking Jerry. He was sat on a small little blue pillow on Macy’s desk, his feathers ruffled and his eyes glazed over. “Hey, are you up for a chat? We gotta talk about something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will… try. My speech… no perfect… yet,” Jerry mumbled slowly. He had been recovering for the 2 weeks since the splash, and though he was mostly back to normal, his speech was still somewhat garbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The, uh… Meggies… have been performing the experiments on the void, and they’re talking about a possible evacuation of the Followers to The City.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Evacuation? Are them crazy?” Jerry exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They,” Macy corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They,” Jerry repeated. “Going to city is suicide for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mach explained what Alex had said, but the bird stayed obstinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why should we trust Meggies? Sinclair are convinced they caused this. They is leading us to trap maybe,” Jerry slowly squawked, his speech slurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sinclair &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, yeah. Normally, I would be more inclined to agree with her, but I’ve known Max since we were children. I thought he was dead for weeks, and I… I can’t leave him again.” Mach crouched down to look her feathered friend in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also can’t, in good conscience, leave you all here to die. Please Jerry, we have to let them handle it,” Macy pleaded. Jerry sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” said Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy didn’t give up. The bird was stubborn, but she was more stubborn still. It took an embarrassingly inordinate amount of begging, but he gave in at last. Staring up at his Anointed One and her gilded blue float, he relented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So be it. I will… try my hardest to defend us, but my strength no fully come back. If I get splashed again, defend others with your life,” Jerry ordered. Macy nodded, helping Jerry up onto her shoulder as she exited the room. As she marched down the hallway, she for all of the Followers to meet in the main room, sitting on the couch or floor as Macy and Jerry took their place in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you know, the Meggies who have been staying with us have been looking into the void in the back room as much as possible. Despite the extensive studying, with Sinclair’s help, there is still a lot that we don’t know about it. We’ve all discussed this, and have decided evacuation is the safest thing to do right now.” A ripple of gasps and murmurs emanated from The Followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where will we go, then?!” one of them exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy paused for a minute, bracing herself for the reaction she would receive. “The Endless City.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she expected, the Followers erupted in an indignant outcry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your job is to do what’s best for us. Going to a level where the majority of people there hate us is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that, ‘Chosen One’.” Father Bluebird retorted mockingly above the din “You’re preventing our deaths by leading us straight to another one!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t understand! At this point, we have two options: stay here and be guaranteed a slow, painful death, or take our chances in The City. This void is not a matter to take lightly,” Macy’s tone carried a grave earnestness. “I’m not forcing any of you to come. If you want to stay here, be my guest. Just know, that we will not come back for you &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you die. As much as some of us hate the Meggies, they’re the only ones who have any chance at possibly stopping this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mach glanced over at Max, who had been watching the proceedings silently next to Alex on the couch. He nodded encouragingly in tacit approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are just not big or powerful enough. Jerry, Sinclair, the Meggie agents here, and I too will be leaving tomorrow morning. Anyone who values Jerry and their life is welcome to follow. For now, I suggest you start packing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the crowd dispersed, Macy walked back into the hallway into her room, shutting the door. She sank into the floor, hugging her knees to her chest and exhaled tiredly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t used to being so authoritative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Macy was surprised at the number of Followers she found waiting for her in the main room. A few, according to Sinclair, had fled on their own or refused to leave the place, but a good three quarters of them had taken Macy’s speech to heart. They milled about the hall, bags packed and ready to leave as soon as she said the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One individual, however, had yet to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where’s Father Bluebird?” Jerry asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right here.” Father Bluebird walked out from the hallway in his usual garb, shooting a grim glare at the M.E.G. operatives. Max beamed, returning a cheerful wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought you were adamant about staying here, old man,” Sinclair snarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father Bluebird snorted in reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of packing, I spent all night finishing a project I’ve been working on, and it turned out very nicely. It seems to have helped me change my mind.” Father Bluebird slowly lifted his right sleeve to reveal the return of previously cut-off hand. He lifted the feathered glove off of it to reveal a fully robotic, metal prosthetic. He wiggled the fingers around, relishing in his handiwork, and glanced over at Alex who was manifestly unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool,” she snapped sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be so flippant, girl. Soon we will have a fair rematch, which will have a much different outcome.” Father Bluebird leered at her evilly under his ridiculous bird-beak mask. Replacing his glove, he leaned against the wall, his blade sticking out from beneath his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of his intimidating demeanor, Alex could barely take him seriously in his comical getup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well then! Where to first?” Max asked, clutching the straps of his backpack giddily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve mapped out the route. We’ll go back to Level 0, noclip into Level 1, find a hallway with pipes and get to Level 2, find a door that leads to Level 4, and then go through a vending machine to get to-” Alex began to spout, but was rudely interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is completely unnecessary, and nobody understands your weird numbers. Follow me, I know a shortcut.” Sinclair walked to the front door and proceeded to repeatedly open and slam the door shut again and again in quick succession. The M.E.G. agents stared at her in bewilderment as she persisted in the manic, repetitive motion, groaning in frustration as it failed to yield her desired result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” Max asked. He looked out the door as it opened, glimpsing into the familiar, mono-yellow rooms of Level 0 each time. After a few more tries, the scene suddenly changed to reveal a long industrial tunnel covered in pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operatives around ‘oohed’ and ‘aahed’ while Sinclair rolled her eyes at how many attempts it took to open into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2&quot;&gt;Pipe Dreams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s new. Since when could you do that?” Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time you open the door, it opens into a random point of what you know as ‘Level 0’, but one of the doors on Pipe Dreams always opens into here as well. Once in a while, it can be opened from the inside as well. Open and close the door enough times, and you get a nice little shortcut. Even more convenient, a door to The Empty Office is only a few feet down.” Alex nodded idiotically at the new information as Sinclair stepped onto the grey concrete floor of Level 2 and turned back to face the group. “Now come on all, let’s get moving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group: 85 people in all — carefully shuffled down the thin tunnels, with Sinclair leading the way. Together with Macy, Jerry perched silently on her shoulder, Max and Alex followed directly behind. The group moved quickly and quietly, bathed in the stark, white fluorescent lighting and the faint echoes of liquid sloshing in the pipes lining the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching a specific door, Sinclair rammed it open with her shoulder, a cloud of dust flying through the air as it burst open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In there,” she commanded, holding the door open for the group. “That should be your ‘Level 4’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex peered in tentatively, squinting at the hallway beyond, which was obscured by the billowing dust. Next to her, an M.E.G. operative stepped forward to go through. As he passed through the wooden doorframe, he stopped abruptly, halting the rest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gavin, are you okay?” Alex asked, confused. The operative began to tip backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all at once, the back half of his body peeled away from the doorframe, falling with a visceral squelch onto the open floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex screamed in shock as she saw the man’s front side had been sliced clean off, exposing all of his bones and entrails. Blood gushed from the exposed bone and organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What happened?!” Max yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get back!” Alex shoved all the other operatives away from the door, now splattered with blood and human viscera. She grabbed a piece of brick off of the floor and tossed through the doorway, watching it suddenly disappear as it passed the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The void… it’s expanded beyond Jerry’s room…” Macy muttered in horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve gotta be screwing me right now. That was our only way to The Empty Office! We’ll be here for hours trying to find another exit!” Sinclair screeched in frustration, punching a hole through another one of the old doors in anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are there any other exits nearby? Anywhere that leads to a safe level?” Alex asked. Sinclair thought for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only one that wouldn’t result in an instant bloodbath is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5&quot;&gt;Terror Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s far from safe or ideal.” Sinclair sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the only way. Show us where it is,” Alex replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they trudged on, Max remembered reading about Level 5 in the database. The thought of encountering &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-18&quot;&gt;The Beast&lt;/a&gt; or his deadly &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1&quot;&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; rushed through his mind. He never thought he would end up in such a horrible place, but Sinclair was right. It was the best move for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair turned the corner and jiggled another doorknob violently until it opened. Carefully, Alex tested the hallway with a brick this time to be certain, and it appeared safe. She stepped in, and led the way with her taser stick erected in front of her as a safety measure. If she ever lost sight of the front of it, she would know before she met the same fate as Gavin. Thankfully, however, a light suddenly emerged from the other side of the doorway. Suddenly, Alex looked around to find herself in an old-fashioned hotel. The rest of the group trickled in through the hallway, passing through a wall consecutively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex looked around the area to assess their new environment, realizing they had entered the hotel’s glorious ballroom of immense grandeur: The Beverly Room. She couldn’t help but admire the beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max suddenly tapped her shoulder and muttered a quiet “Alex…” in her ear. She looked behind her, and her eyes widened. An array of flashing lights caught her eye as sounds of slot machines echoed throughout the enormous ballroom, which made cathedrals look like an apartment block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of all freaking places in this blasted hotel, it had to be here, didn’t it?” Alex grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, well. It’s been a while since we’ve spoken to each other, hasn’t it, Jerry?” A deep, British voice spoke behind them softly. Max and Alex turned around to see a humanoid creature with a squid-like head staring at them. Max gasped and stumbled backwards. The beast chuckled as it sipped on a cup of tea. “Come now, my friends. Why don’t we catch up a little bit over some tea in my new casino? I can assure you that whatever you wish can be arranged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why would we ever listen to you, beast?!” Sinclair snarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I’m sure you’re smarter than that, no? That is, unless you’d prefer traversing through &lt;strong&gt;The Decay&lt;/strong&gt;,” The Beast replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?” Max asked, concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Enjoy!</p> </blockquote> <p>Max stared at her, unable to comprehend what was happening. His felt his throat close up, a sharp pain rushing through his neck as the cogs spun wildly in his brain.</p> <p>“Macy?”</p> <p>The woman had lowered her hood, the gilded blue facade falling to reveal short-shaven hair and dark eyes that widened at him in surprise.</p> <p>“Max…” she whispered. The pair stood silently, eyeing one another in utter disbelief for what seemed like an eternity. Max could feel his eyes begin to water. A tear trickled down his cheek as he recognized the familiar voice of the friend he thought he had lost forever.</p> <p>Then, all at once, Max found himself sprinting forward, enveloping Macy in a tight hug. He buried his face into her left shoulder, earning a disapproving squawk from the blue macaw perched on the other.</p> <p>&quot;I thought you were dead!&quot; Macy stammered through tears.</p> <p>&quot;I thought <em>you</em> were dead!&quot; Max choked out a laugh, still locked in his old partner’s warm embrace.</p> <p>&quot;MAX! <strong><em>STOP</em></strong>!&quot;</p> <p>Alex charged forward, shoving Max violently away from the woman in blue. He stumbled backward, colliding into the wall with a loud thud.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Max roared. He watched as the other operatives around him drew their clubs, crossbows, and tasers, pointing them all directly at Macy. Behind her, the Followers too poised themselves, their glinting blades pulled from their sheaths and held at the ready.</p> <p>Grabbing Max’s shirt, Alex pinned him against the wall, and unslung her backpack.</p> <p>&quot;Hold still!&quot; Alex ordered. Unzipping her bag, she whipped out a small thermos flask. Twisting off the cap in a single, swift motion, she forced his mouth open, sloshing half its contents haphazardly over his face and down his throat. Lifting back her head, she proceeded to down several gulps of liquid herself. Max spluttered as the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1">Almond Water</a> soaked his face and shirt, revolted by the wretched taste of the foul fluid.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing?! I haven't seen her in months!” He yelled through coughs, still choking. “Why did you-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Max, are you <em>blind</em>?! Do you have any idea what the <em>monster</em> is that’s sitting on her shoulder?!&quot; Alex interrupted, her voice raised in fury.</p> <p>Max turned back to Macy. The parrot on her shoulder cocked its head and lifted its beak, almost like it was smiling. It winked at them, as if in reply.</p> <p>&quot;It's just a stupid bird!&quot; The Followers gasped at the bold statement, raising their blades in outrage. Reflexively, the M.E.G. operatives too pointed their weapons forward.</p> <p>Alex sighed in exasperation at her partner's ignorance. She turned to the captive held among her compatriots, who was grinning gleefully at the mayhem, dark ink dripping from her lips onto the carpet.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair! You didn't tell me <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7">Jerry</a> was going to be here!&quot; Alex screamed venomously.</p> <p>Max's eyes widened as he realized that this was <em>the</em> Jerry he had heard about. Innocuous as the bird appeared, the nefarious avian held within his talons the power to put any living mind under his full and total control. The megalomaniac, so he’d heard, would corral all of his victims into the cage of a violently unhinged and despotic cult — with Macy, apparently, as its most recent victim. The bird on her shoulder fixed its gaze upon him, its yellow eyes glinting with haughty mischief.</p> <p>As his mind connected the dots, Max felt his chest tighten. His breathing sped up in a panicked manner.</p> <p>&quot;I apologize for interrupting, but it seems that the rumors you Meggies like to spread have tainted my reputation. Why don't we all just calm down for a moment?&quot; Jerry flew off of Macy's shoulder, settling onto one of the room's many perches, right next to Alex.</p> <p>He regretted this almost instantly.</p> <p>Instinctively, Alex let our a shrill cry, flinging what remained of the Almond Water in the thermos onto the bird without hesitation.</p> <p>Jerry screeched in immense pain as the liquid soaked into his feathers. Falling off his perch, he landed on the floor next to Max, and began to seize with excruciating spasms.</p> <p>&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&quot; Sinclair howled. She rushed forward, soothing her master in her shaking hands as he writhed in agony. Behind her, the cultists erupted into a cacophonous outcry and rushed forward, blades waving wildly in the air. Hurriedly, Macy turned to halt them, her arms raised in a vain attempt to pacify their anguished clamor.</p> <p>Alex was taken aback. She’d had no idea that “taming” Jerry would cause him this much pain.</p> <p>&quot;Alex-&quot; Max muttered urgently.</p> <p>Out of the seething mob, Father Bluebird lunged at Alex with with an inhuman ferocity, sword raised in his hand.</p> <p>As if on cue, the room then exploded into chaos.</p> <p>The operatives and the Followers charged, colliding at the center of the room in a flurry of sticks and blades. With lighting speed, Alex drew her trusty taser stick from her side and just barely parried the cruel slash of Father Bluebird’s blade. She sprung into action, retaliating with a powerful backhand swing that forced the cultist backward. As they traded blows, two or three other agents drew their own weapons, sprinting over to defend her.</p> <p>Under ordinary circumstances, defeating an expert swordsman like this alone in combat would have been near impossible, even with backup. This time, however, Alex had an advantage. Between her thrusts and strikes, she noticed the weakness of Father Bluebird’s blows — how easily they gave, and how with each strike and parry he had been slowly backed toward the center of the room.</p> <p>The old man swung his blade forward again, aiming straight for her jugular, and she parried. Their weapons connected in a deadlock, electric bolts arcing dangerously from her stick onto her opponent’s lustrous blade. He panted hard, eyes blazing with murderous intent beneath his mask. Despite his size and strength, he was struggling, his weapon shaking and nearly buckling as Alex pushed back against it with her club. She glanced at his hilt, desperately looking for a way to escape the bind, and found — oddly enough — that he was holding his weapon one-handed, his stance similar to a traditional fencer. Her keen eyes darted over to his other arm, and quickly found the reason why.</p> <p>His other hand had been amputated.</p> <p>With a surge of confidence, Alex sprung forward and got out of the bind, clocking a few more vicious strikes against the Father’s blade before finally disarming the man, the sword flying from his grip like a throwing star and lodging itself in a nearby wall. She held her stick near his neck, the loose bolts of electricity singing his skin. Turning toward her fellow agents, she blew off a stray hair that had fallen across her face and glared at them with a cocky, triumphant visage, relishing in her solo victory against the notorious criminal.</p> <p>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Macy screamed. At the word of their anointed one, the cultists froze, ceasing abruptly in their assault. The conflict dissipated as quickly as it had begun.</p> <p>Sidestepping the bruised and battered combatants, Macy strode over to Sinclair, still cradling the unconscious Jerry. All around the room, eyes hung on her in anticipation.</p> <p>She stared down at the defeated bird, considering if she should just grab Max and run away from all this.</p> <p>The macaw’s feathers twitched weakly, its wicked claws grasping faintly at the air.</p> <p>She thought about it long and hard, glancing at Max, who seemed flustered from the recent quarrel.</p> <p>On one hand, this might be the perfect opportunity for an escape. On the other… where would she even go? Would the ‘Meggies' even take her in after her involvement with the cult? And was it really worth the risk of Jerry waking up and sending a witch hunt after her?</p> <p>She let the idea slide, fear lingering unpleasantly in her mind. Ar the very least, Jerry hadn’t been keen on the conflict. Perhaps rousing him and getting two feuding parties to cooperate would be the best option for now. Bending down, she stroked the bird’s small head, attempting to wake him up. The bird stirred, vacant eyes staring up at Mach.</p> <p>&quot;Almighty Jerry?&quot; Sinclair muttered softly. Jerry said nothing. Like an ordinary parrot, he cooed quietly.</p> <p>&quot;Jerry, you're ugly,&quot; Max taunted put of nowhere. The Followers gasped, but their shock quickly turned to Jerry as he continued to stare blankly, making no response to his remark.</p> <p>&quot;Woah… nothing! Alex, whatever you did, I think you turned its brain off.&quot;</p> <p>Reaching for his sword, Father Bluebird recovered from his place on the ground and loomed over to Alex.</p> <p>If a mere look could kill, Alex would have died on the spot.</p> <p>&quot;Under normal circumstances, I would've either impaled or beheaded you, maybe even both; but you can see that I'm currently missing something,&quot; he said waving his hand-less arm. &quot;So all I'm going to ask you to do is to <strong>get out</strong>.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Way ahead of you. You freaks can deal with your own issues.&quot; Alex opened the front door into Level 0, beckoning Max and the other operatives to follow.</p> <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Macy cried desperately. She stretched her hand out toward the agents, who had already begun to file out the door. Alex glanced backward at them, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>&quot;I know this has been rough, but I’ve seen what that void can do. It's growing bigger by the day, and we can't just ignore it until it consumes our whole room. Please, help us.&quot;</p> <p>Alex stared back at her coldly, eyeing her blue robes with disdain. She opened her mouth to deny her request and continue out the door. Before she did so, however, she turned to Max, who nudged her with pathetic pleading eyes. Alex had no clue how they knew each other, but it was clear that he didn’t want to leave his friend behind again. She sighed, still infuriated by Sinclair’s treacherous deceit. Yet, as much as she hated to admit it, her sympathy for her friend outmatched the hate she had for the FOJ.</p> <p>&quot;Where is it?&quot; she muttered reluctantly, motioning her fellow operatives back through the door.</p> <p>Macy heaved a sigh of relief.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair, Father Bluebird, watch Jerry in case he wakes up,” Macy ordered. “I'll show them the void.&quot; She beckoned Max, Alex, and the other agents forward, and they followed her into the hallways of the lounge. As they rounded the corner, the sight that greeted them left them all in shock. The void had, by now, extended halfway into the room, couches sticking bizarrely out of the inky black wall.</p> <p>&quot;Oh goodness. This doesn't look good,&quot; Max said in awe.</p> <p>&quot;Yep, and it's growing. A few weeks ago it had pretty much just replaced the back wall. Now, half the room is gone. Sinclair was the first to notice the movement, but we all just thought she was having another episode. Now, we’re kinda starting to realize this is actually a problem.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I've never seen anything like this. When did it start?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;When I first got here, Sinclair was bringing Jerry, Father Bluebird, and a couple more of our guys to take a look at it. I'm assuming it must've started right around then. As for <em>how</em> it started, Sinclair still thinks you M.E.G. agents did this. Do you know anything about that?&quot; Macy shot Alex a worried look, secretly hoping she had an answer.</p> <p>&quot;Well, I don't have all-access credentials, so there's always the possibility that the higher-ups accidentally did something and tried to cover it up. But personally, I've heard nothing about a growing, black void.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Did you try touching it, or throwing something into it?&quot; Max asked curiously.</p> <p>&quot;How do you think Father Bluebird lost his hand? Whatever goes in, doesn't come back out,&quot; Macy replied. She grabbed one of Jerry's golden perches, and poked the end of it into the void. As she pulled it back out, the portion which had made contact with the void was gone. The agents gasped to see that the metal had been sliced like butter in only a second.</p> <p>&quot;This <em>is</em> bad.&quot; Max rubbed the newly flattened end of the perch in surprise. He half-expected it to be warm like it had melted off, or cold after being in pure void, but it was simply… nothing. It was a clean, sharp break, smooth to the point of being wholly unnatural.</p> <p>&quot;We should report this. This is really bad,&quot; one of the other agents chimed in.</p> <p>&quot;Do you think we could find Base Gamma on <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3">Level 3</a>? We might be able to portal there through the front door. I've seen Sinclair do that a few times,&quot; Macy suggested.</p> <p>&quot;No no no. We can't file an official report yet. If they <em>are</em> trying to cover something up, and we flag this off as a third-party, we could get involved in something… and trust me, it will not be pretty. And even if it turns out there they are actually clueless about it, the underseers are gonna stick their noses all into this and declare your room a deadzone or something. Verne and his prying research staff will be crawling all over this in a matter of minutes, putting all of you guys out of a home. For now, we need to see if we can figure this out ourselves.&quot; Max replied.</p> <p>“Lovely. Now we’re gonna have to hunker down in this madhouse.” Alex groaned.</p> <p>“I’ll go prepare a room for each of you,” Macy replied. Sinclair and Father Bluebird would hardly be pleased with the offer, but with Jerry floored, they’d be forced to respect her as their superior. Being the “anointed one” came with privileges.</p> <p>The operatives strode back into the main room where most of the Followers remained, huddling over their dumbed-down master. Sinclair walked up to the two, a tad more calm than usual. Her long, greasy hair waved behind her as she approached them.</p> <p>“Hey guys, so uh… no hard feelings about the whole Snackrooms rampage.” She rubbed her arm sheepishly. “You guys are either really clueless or really good actors. I’ve been studying this void thing for weeks and I don’t&nbsp;get it. There’s nothing on your database about it, no books, no people who know about it, nothing. It just appeared. My bad…” Sinclair gave them a concerned look, seeming genuine for once.</p> <p>“Don’t worry about it. As much as I hate having a knife inches away from being plunged into my neck, I’ve pretty much gotten used to it. Cop training is brutal.”</p> <p>“Ah, so you’re a cop too? Just like Macy?”</p> <p>“At this point ‘was’ is probably the better word. I’ve kinda come to terms with the fact that I’m not getting out of here.” Max shrugged. “So, if I may ask, how did Macy become, like…” Max shifted uncomfortably, struggling to find the right words, “…your, uh… leader?”</p> <p>“She just showed up out of the blue. Father Bluebird found her hiding behind the couch. She would’ve died if Jerry didn’t stop him from slicing her neck open.”</p> <p>Max’s heart dropped. A chill went up his spine as he imagined the thought of Macy dying. If things had transpired differently, he probably wouldn’t have ever even known.</p> <p>“Geez.” He rubbed his temples. The exhaustion from the whole ordeal was just beginning to set in. Sinclair motioned for Max to follow strolling onto a nearby couch. The two of them flopped down, watching the agents and cultists alike streaming busily by. Alex had wandered off somewhere, probably bossing the operatives with some trivial detail or another.</p> <p>“And so when Macy showed up… that was around the time you guys found the… void?” Max continued.</p> <p>“Yeah. After she was anointed the Chosen One, I started performing extensive performing tests on the void with what few resources we had for this kind of thing. Hopefully you guys will have better luck with all your fancy, newfangled junk.”</p> <p>“That was the plan. Macy’s preparing a few rooms for us right now so we can stay for a few days. You interested in helping?”</p> <p>Sinclair folded her arms, and leaned back against the sofa placidly.</p> <p>“As much as I’d love to say no, it’s for the best.”</p> <p>“Alright then. I’d say we take 5 for today, and then take a crack at it tomorrow.” Max sighed. “It was a long way down here, and I'm beat.”</p> <hr /> <div style="font: 1.75rem 'Caveat Brush'"> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Void Experiment #1: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-15">Firesalt</a></p> <p>Okay, this is Max Blackfield writing. Our first experiment — throwing a whole pound of Firesalt into the void — was a failure. Half of the explosion went right through the void, while the other half heavily damaged the room. We waited for a day to see if the rate of the void’s growth would slow down or speed up, but we didn’t notice any differences. Sinclair was able to figure out that the void moves between 10-50cm per day. The rate didn’t seem to change at all after we measured using the length of what was left of the room. For the next experiment, we’re going to go a little more heavy duty and attempt to throw a deuclidator at it.</p> </div> <hr /> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Void Experiment #2: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4">Deuclidator</a></p> <p>Our next experiment was putting a deuclidator right in front of the void. This experiment yielded more interesting results than the prior. Upon activation, the void actually <em>receded</em> slightly. It revealed parts of what it had consumed, except for the fact that they were turned into black and crispy husks of what they used to be. We left it on for the entire day, which seemed to work initially, but after it ran out of battery, the void to move again as normal. This may be important to stopping this. Tomorrow, we’re going to try liquid pain.</p> </div> <hr /> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Void Experiment #3: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-48">Liquid Pain</a></p> <p>For this experiment, we attempted to splash the void with a whole bottle of liquid pain. Our intention was to see if this would cause a reaction, possibly proving if the void is alive. I know that doesn’t sound likely, but… you can never be too sure with The Backrooms, I suppose. The liquid pain didn’t seem to have any effect on the void, just swallowing it up like any other old object. We’re going to perform another sentience test in a second with a Scaraback. I’ll put it on the next page.</p> </div> <hr /> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Void Experiment #4: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-14">Scaraback</a></p> <p>This is by far the most interesting result we’ve had so far. Alex was holding the Scaraback just in front of the void. Upon activation, she began to hear a loud, piercing scream in her ear. The screaming didn’t stop until I intervened and deactivated the Scaraback. We tried this again, this time with Sinclair as the holder, but this time it had no noticeable effects whatsoever.</p> <p>Tomorrow’s experiment is likely going to be the most dangerous.</p> </div> <hr /> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Void Experiment #5: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-42">Black Bottled Lightning</a></p> <p>This experiment took a few days due to the major safety precautions we had to take. This stuff is incredibly dangerous. Once we made sure everyone was out of the way, I went in with a full hazmat suit and opened a bottle of Black Lightning in front of the void. The lightning shot out quickly and spread all over the wall of black void, zapping and crackling as it did went. This lasted for a few minutes before it eventually burnt out. For three whole days, the void didn’t seem to move at all, remaining dormant. Electrical charges in the air were also unnaturally high in close proximity to the void. It’s the fourth day now, the void has just begun moving again at its normal rate.</p> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>“Hey Max, are you done documenting the lightning experiment?” Alex asked. Max sat next to her on a couch in the main room scribbling furiously into his notebook.</p> <p>“Yep, just finished. So, it looks like the Deuclidators and Bottled lightning can stop the void from moving, Firesalt and Liquid Pain had no effect, and the Scaraback has only made us question even more if the thing is alive. Overall, it’s a net gain I’d say.”</p> <p>“That’s great. Though, I did wanna discuss something with you in private,” Alex replied. Max looked up from his notebook quizzically.</p> <p>“What’s up?”</p> <p>“I’m starting to have second thoughts about this whole ‘not telling the rest of the M.E.G.’ thing I was saying the other day.” Alex leaned in, speaking in a hushed tone.</p> <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“In the two weeks it took us to perform those experiments, the void has almost consumed the entire room now. At this rate, the entirety of Jerry’s room will probably be consumed in a few months months. This may sound a little drastic, but I’m beginning to think we may need to evacuate these guys to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>.” Alex glanced furtively behind her, hoping that nobody was eavesdropping.</p> <p>“Are you sure? I mean, loads of folks in the FOJ are considered armed and dangerous by the higher-ups, there’s a chance some of them could even get killed just for stepping foot into M.E.G. dominant territory, especially if we pass through 6.1 first.”</p> <p>“Yes, yes, I’m aware. As much as I hate them, though, they’re still just Jerry’s victims, and we can’t leave them here to die. At least they’ve got a shot if they come with us. One way or another, letting them stay is cruel. For all we know, this thing might just be waiting to pounce. Any day now, it might just speed through the room and kill us all before we can even blink.”</p> <p>The pair turned to peek at the inky black wall just down the corridor. It was visible from where they were sitting now, though it hadn’t been just a few days ago. The thing continued to creep forward, encroaching upon the room at an imperceptibly slow pace, its unbroken darkness consuming the walls and floor ever so slowly.</p> <p>They both shuddered.</p> <p>“We can’t stay here much longer.” Alex’s voice carried a rightful note of urgency. “The best thing to do may just be to relay this information to one of the higher-ups and possibly work on building a machine to stop it. If we can talk to the Backrooms Robotics… maybe they could design a cannon that shoots bottled lightning every few days… or some kind of massive Deuclidation-field generator or something. We may actually be able to contain this within Jerry’s room.”</p> <p>Max chewed on the end of his pen, contemplating her words. A chill ran down his spine as he imagined the void appearing out of nowhere in front of him, swallowing him whole in milliseconds.</p> <p>“You’re right. We need to evacuate. We’ll have to talk to Macy about this — she’s the most reasonable one here.</p> <p>“No need, I heard all of it.” Macy stepped in through the front door, revealing her presence.</p> <p>“Where were you?” Alex asked.</p> <p>“On a quick run to The Electrical Station to grab some supplies. As you pointed out, Followers are less welcome in places like The City, so we tend to stick to The Empty Office or The Electrical Station for our groceries and supplies. So, you’re thinking we need to evacuate this place?” Macy asked.</p> <p>“Well, you heard us, didn’t you? The void is unpredictable. For all we know, it could randomly decide to show up on this side of the wall and corner us until we get consumed by it,” Max reached behind him to tap on the wall behind him with his knuckle.</p> <p>“Well, I-I just…” Macy stammered.</p> <p>“Look, I understand your little bird cult is important to you, but your lives are far more valuable than… this.” Alex waved her arms around the room. “If you all want to stay here and die, be my guest, but I can guarantee you that <em>we</em> won’t be sticking around much longer.”</p> <p>Macy pondered for a moment before replying, soaking in Alex’s words. “Give me some time to think. I’ll let you know within a few hours. I’m going to go see if Jerry well enough to talk, as much as I don’t like being alone with him.” Macy sighed, and walked past them and into the a hallway.</p> <p>Macy opened the door to her room to see a tired-looking Jerry. He was sat on a small little blue pillow on Macy’s desk, his feathers ruffled and his eyes glazed over. “Hey, are you up for a chat? We gotta talk about something.”</p> <p>“I will… try. My speech… no perfect… yet,” Jerry mumbled slowly. He had been recovering for the 2 weeks since the splash, and though he was mostly back to normal, his speech was still somewhat garbled.</p> <p>“The, uh… Meggies… have been performing the experiments on the void, and they’re talking about a possible evacuation of the Followers to The City.”</p> <p>“Evacuation? Are them crazy?” Jerry exclaimed.</p> <p>“They,” Macy corrected.</p> <p>“They,” Jerry repeated. “Going to city is suicide for us.”</p> <p>Mach explained what Alex had said, but the bird stayed obstinate.</p> <p>“Why should we trust Meggies? Sinclair are convinced they caused this. They is leading us to trap maybe,” Jerry slowly squawked, his speech slurred.</p> <p>“Sinclair <em>is</em>, yeah. Normally, I would be more inclined to agree with her, but I’ve known Max since we were children. I thought he was dead for weeks, and I… I can’t leave him again.” Mach crouched down to look her feathered friend in the eye.</p> <p>I also can’t, in good conscience, leave you all here to die. Please Jerry, we have to let them handle it,” Macy pleaded. Jerry sighed.</p> <p>“No,” said Jerry.</p> <p>Macy didn’t give up. The bird was stubborn, but she was more stubborn still. It took an embarrassingly inordinate amount of begging, but he gave in at last. Staring up at his Anointed One and her gilded blue float, he relented.</p> <p>“So be it. I will… try my hardest to defend us, but my strength no fully come back. If I get splashed again, defend others with your life,” Jerry ordered. Macy nodded, helping Jerry up onto her shoulder as she exited the room. As she marched down the hallway, she for all of the Followers to meet in the main room, sitting on the couch or floor as Macy and Jerry took their place in the center.</p> <p>“As you know, the Meggies who have been staying with us have been looking into the void in the back room as much as possible. Despite the extensive studying, with Sinclair’s help, there is still a lot that we don’t know about it. We’ve all discussed this, and have decided evacuation is the safest thing to do right now.” A ripple of gasps and murmurs emanated from The Followers.</p> <p>“Where will we go, then?!” one of them exclaimed.</p> <p>Macy paused for a minute, bracing herself for the reaction she would receive. “The Endless City.”</p> <p>As she expected, the Followers erupted in an indignant outcry.</p> <p>“Your job is to do what’s best for us. Going to a level where the majority of people there hate us is <em>not</em> that, ‘Chosen One’.” Father Bluebird retorted mockingly above the din “You’re preventing our deaths by leading us straight to another one!”</p> <p>“You don’t understand! At this point, we have two options: stay here and be guaranteed a slow, painful death, or take our chances in The City. This void is not a matter to take lightly,” Macy’s tone carried a grave earnestness. “I’m not forcing any of you to come. If you want to stay here, be my guest. Just know, that we will not come back for you <em>when</em> you die. As much as some of us hate the Meggies, they’re the only ones who have any chance at possibly stopping this.”</p> <p>Mach glanced over at Max, who had been watching the proceedings silently next to Alex on the couch. He nodded encouragingly in tacit approval.</p> <p>“We are just not big or powerful enough. Jerry, Sinclair, the Meggie agents here, and I too will be leaving tomorrow morning. Anyone who values Jerry and their life is welcome to follow. For now, I suggest you start packing.”</p> <p>As the crowd dispersed, Macy walked back into the hallway into her room, shutting the door. She sank into the floor, hugging her knees to her chest and exhaled tiredly.</p> <p>She wasn’t used to being so authoritative.</p> <hr /> <p>The next morning, Macy was surprised at the number of Followers she found waiting for her in the main room. A few, according to Sinclair, had fled on their own or refused to leave the place, but a good three quarters of them had taken Macy’s speech to heart. They milled about the hall, bags packed and ready to leave as soon as she said the word.</p> <p>One individual, however, had yet to be accounted for.</p> <p>“Where’s Father Bluebird?” Jerry asked.</p> <p>“Right here.” Father Bluebird walked out from the hallway in his usual garb, shooting a grim glare at the M.E.G. operatives. Max beamed, returning a cheerful wave.</p> <p>“I thought you were adamant about staying here, old man,” Sinclair snarked.</p> <p>Father Bluebird snorted in reply.</p> <p>“Instead of packing, I spent all night finishing a project I’ve been working on, and it turned out very nicely. It seems to have helped me change my mind.” Father Bluebird slowly lifted his right sleeve to reveal the return of previously cut-off hand. He lifted the feathered glove off of it to reveal a fully robotic, metal prosthetic. He wiggled the fingers around, relishing in his handiwork, and glanced over at Alex who was manifestly unimpressed.</p> <p>“Cool,” she snapped sarcastically.</p> <p>“Don’t be so flippant, girl. Soon we will have a fair rematch, which will have a much different outcome.” Father Bluebird leered at her evilly under his ridiculous bird-beak mask. Replacing his glove, he leaned against the wall, his blade sticking out from beneath his back.</p> <p>In spite of his intimidating demeanor, Alex could barely take him seriously in his comical getup.</p> <p>“Well then! Where to first?” Max asked, clutching the straps of his backpack giddily.</p> <p>“I’ve mapped out the route. We’ll go back to Level 0, noclip into Level 1, find a hallway with pipes and get to Level 2, find a door that leads to Level 4, and then go through a vending machine to get to-” Alex began to spout, but was rudely interrupted.</p> <p>“That is completely unnecessary, and nobody understands your weird numbers. Follow me, I know a shortcut.” Sinclair walked to the front door and proceeded to repeatedly open and slam the door shut again and again in quick succession. The M.E.G. agents stared at her in bewilderment as she persisted in the manic, repetitive motion, groaning in frustration as it failed to yield her desired result.</p> <p>“What are you doing?” Max asked. He looked out the door as it opened, glimpsing into the familiar, mono-yellow rooms of Level 0 each time. After a few more tries, the scene suddenly changed to reveal a long industrial tunnel covered in pipes.</p> <p>The operatives around ‘oohed’ and ‘aahed’ while Sinclair rolled her eyes at how many attempts it took to open into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2">Pipe Dreams</a>.</p> <p>“That’s new. Since when could you do that?” Alex asked.</p> <p>“Every time you open the door, it opens into a random point of what you know as ‘Level 0’, but one of the doors on Pipe Dreams always opens into here as well. Once in a while, it can be opened from the inside as well. Open and close the door enough times, and you get a nice little shortcut. Even more convenient, a door to The Empty Office is only a few feet down.” Alex nodded idiotically at the new information as Sinclair stepped onto the grey concrete floor of Level 2 and turned back to face the group. “Now come on all, let’s get moving.”</p> <p>The group: 85 people in all — carefully shuffled down the thin tunnels, with Sinclair leading the way. Together with Macy, Jerry perched silently on her shoulder, Max and Alex followed directly behind. The group moved quickly and quietly, bathed in the stark, white fluorescent lighting and the faint echoes of liquid sloshing in the pipes lining the walls.</p> <p>Approaching a specific door, Sinclair rammed it open with her shoulder, a cloud of dust flying through the air as it burst open.</p> <p>“In there,” she commanded, holding the door open for the group. “That should be your ‘Level 4’.”</p> <p>Alex peered in tentatively, squinting at the hallway beyond, which was obscured by the billowing dust. Next to her, an M.E.G. operative stepped forward to go through. As he passed through the wooden doorframe, he stopped abruptly, halting the rest of the group.</p> <p>“Gavin, are you okay?” Alex asked, confused. The operative began to tip backward.</p> <p>Then, all at once, the back half of his body peeled away from the doorframe, falling with a visceral squelch onto the open floor.</p> <p>Alex screamed in shock as she saw the man’s front side had been sliced clean off, exposing all of his bones and entrails. Blood gushed from the exposed bone and organs.</p> <p>“What happened?!” Max yelled.</p> <p>“Get back!” Alex shoved all the other operatives away from the door, now splattered with blood and human viscera. She grabbed a piece of brick off of the floor and tossed through the doorway, watching it suddenly disappear as it passed the threshold.</p> <p>“The void… it’s expanded beyond Jerry’s room…” Macy muttered in horror.</p> <p>“You’ve gotta be screwing me right now. That was our only way to The Empty Office! We’ll be here for hours trying to find another exit!” Sinclair screeched in frustration, punching a hole through another one of the old doors in anger.</p> <p>“Are there any other exits nearby? Anywhere that leads to a safe level?” Alex asked. Sinclair thought for a moment.</p> <p>“The only one that wouldn’t result in an instant bloodbath is the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Terror Hotel</a>, but that’s far from safe or ideal.” Sinclair sighed.</p> <p>“It’s the only way. Show us where it is,” Alex replied.</p> <p>As they trudged on, Max remembered reading about Level 5 in the database. The thought of encountering <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-18">The Beast</a> or his deadly <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1">casino</a> rushed through his mind. He never thought he would end up in such a horrible place, but Sinclair was right. It was the best move for the time being.</p> <p>Sinclair turned the corner and jiggled another doorknob violently until it opened. Carefully, Alex tested the hallway with a brick this time to be certain, and it appeared safe. She stepped in, and led the way with her taser stick erected in front of her as a safety measure. If she ever lost sight of the front of it, she would know before she met the same fate as Gavin. Thankfully, however, a light suddenly emerged from the other side of the doorway. Suddenly, Alex looked around to find herself in an old-fashioned hotel. The rest of the group trickled in through the hallway, passing through a wall consecutively.</p> <p>Alex looked around the area to assess their new environment, realizing they had entered the hotel’s glorious ballroom of immense grandeur: The Beverly Room. She couldn’t help but admire the beauty.</p> <p>Max suddenly tapped her shoulder and muttered a quiet “Alex…” in her ear. She looked behind her, and her eyes widened. An array of flashing lights caught her eye as sounds of slot machines echoed throughout the enormous ballroom, which made cathedrals look like an apartment block.</p> <p>“Of all freaking places in this blasted hotel, it had to be here, didn’t it?” Alex grumbled.</p> <p>“Well, well. It’s been a while since we’ve spoken to each other, hasn’t it, Jerry?” A deep, British voice spoke behind them softly. Max and Alex turned around to see a humanoid creature with a squid-like head staring at them. Max gasped and stumbled backwards. The beast chuckled as it sipped on a cup of tea. “Come now, my friends. Why don’t we catch up a little bit over some tea in my new casino? I can assure you that whatever you wish can be arranged.”</p> <p>“Why would we ever listen to you, beast?!” Sinclair snarked.</p> <p>“Because I’m sure you’re smarter than that, no? That is, unless you’d prefer traversing through <strong>The Decay</strong>,” The Beast replied.</p> <p>“The <em>what</em>?” Max asked, concerned.</p> <p>“Come with me.”</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="font: 1.5rem 'Mate SC'"> <p><strong>The Broken City will continue in Chapter 4</strong></p> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/macy">Macy</a> | <strong>Meggies</strong> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/terror">Terror</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> Paper<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> paper-texture-07<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> Max Stanworth<br /> <strong>License:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY-2.0</a><br /> <strong>Source Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/28920179@N03/7585527758">https://www.flickr.com/photos/28920179@N03/7585527758</a></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Additional Note:</strong><br /> Mobile CSS fixes by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8055329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713002" alt="scutoid studios" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8055329)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios" >scutoid studios</a></span>!</p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713002" alt="Natedagreat563" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" >Natedagreat563</a></span></p>

&lt;p&gt;An attempt to photograph Level 6.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.3&lt;/strong&gt; is a sub-section of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6&quot;&gt;Level 6&lt;/a&gt;. This sub-section consists entirely of Vantablack rooms which have been rampantly consumed by The Decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.3&lt;/strong&gt; is a series of interconnected black hallways similar to Level 6 albeit the walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in vantablack paint. It is assumed that the walls, floor, and ceiling are all made of smooth stone as its texture suggests. Any attempt to remove the paint even by a marginal amount has failed, and lights have even less of an effect compared to Level 6 due to the level&#039;s nature. Photography in the level is nearly impossible due to its design and similar nature to Level 6. There is also a phenomenon wherein those who enter cannot exit the way they came from in the level, and it is possible that the sub-section is completely randomized and actively shifts when not observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Level 6, entities have not been observed in this sub-section. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3&quot;&gt;Smilers&lt;/a&gt; have not been documented to enter the area despite its prime condition for the entity. Voices may be heard from the walls, but these appear to be entirely inside the wanderer&#039;s head and partially personalized. These voices can say variations of phrases such as: &amp;quot;Help me&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Save us&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Look at &lt;tt&gt;the sky&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Please don&#039;t leave.&amp;quot; The variations of these are tailored to persuade any wanderer into staying in the level or into looking at &lt;tt&gt;the sky&lt;/tt&gt;. The occurrence seems to be uncommon, happening only with 1 out of 8 wanderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sky:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-3/level-6-3_sky.png&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;so beautiful&amp;#8230;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion, one can find pieces of a wall or ceiling broken, which reveals an inaccessible part of the sub-section known as &lt;tt&gt;the sky&lt;/tt&gt;. It appears to be a cloudy sky that is in a permanent night, with a &lt;tt&gt;beautiful&lt;/tt&gt; bright full moon which does not change phase. Stars and other heavenly bodies cannot be observed in the sky due to its &lt;tt&gt;comforting clouds&lt;/tt&gt;. The sky appears to be able to &lt;tt&gt;attract&lt;/tt&gt; wanderers due to its &lt;tt&gt;elegant allure&lt;/tt&gt; and should &lt;tt&gt;be given attention&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color:#000000; font-size:38px&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decay Presence&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;strong&gt;Level 6.3&lt;/strong&gt; appears to have been mostly consumed by The Decay, which swiftly became rampant several months after the discovery of the sub-lev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It appears&amp;#8230; You have come to visit me?&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Please, save us.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Suffer along with us, don&#039;t leave us alone in this void.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Succumb to this void, one that consumes all into nothing.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Decay is a natural state of this place&amp;#8230; Let yourself succumb to it too.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This sub-section consists entirely of Vantablack rooms which have been rampantly consumed by The Decay.</p> <h1><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h1> <p><strong>Level 6.3</strong> is a series of interconnected black hallways similar to Level 6 albeit the walls, floor, and ceiling are all covered in vantablack paint. It is assumed that the walls, floor, and ceiling are all made of smooth stone as its texture suggests. Any attempt to remove the paint even by a marginal amount has failed, and lights have even less of an effect compared to Level 6 due to the level's nature. Photography in the level is nearly impossible due to its design and similar nature to Level 6. There is also a phenomenon wherein those who enter cannot exit the way they came from in the level, and it is possible that the sub-section is completely randomized and actively shifts when not observed.</p> <p>Unlike in Level 6, entities have not been observed in this sub-section. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3">Smilers</a> have not been documented to enter the area despite its prime condition for the entity. Voices may be heard from the walls, but these appear to be entirely inside the wanderer's head and partially personalized. These voices can say variations of phrases such as: &quot;Help me&quot;, &quot;Save us&quot;, &quot;Look at <tt>the sky</tt>&quot;, and &quot;Please don't leave.&quot; The variations of these are tailored to persuade any wanderer into staying in the level or into looking at <tt>the sky</tt>. The occurrence seems to be uncommon, happening only with 1 out of 8 wanderers.</p> <h3><span><strong>The Sky:</strong></span></h3> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-6-3/level-6-3_sky.png" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p><tt>so beautiful&#8230;</tt></p> </div> </div> <p>On occasion, one can find pieces of a wall or ceiling broken, which reveals an inaccessible part of the sub-section known as <tt>the sky</tt>. It appears to be a cloudy sky that is in a permanent night, with a <tt>beautiful</tt> bright full moon which does not change phase. Stars and other heavenly bodies cannot be observed in the sky due to its <tt>comforting clouds</tt>. The sky appears to be able to <tt>attract</tt> wanderers due to its <tt>elegant allure</tt> and should <tt>be given attention</tt>.</p> <div style="color:#000000; font-size:38px"> <p><strong>Decay Presence</strong>:</p> </div> <p>Recently, <strong>Level 6.3</strong> appears to have been mostly consumed by The Decay, which swiftly became rampant several months after the discovery of the sub-lev</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><tt>It appears&#8230;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font: 3rem &#039;Mate SC&#039;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Broken City: Chapter Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Macy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font: 1.5rem &#039;Mate SC&#039;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Much earlier&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Max sat in the driver&#039;s seat of his police car, looking out of the windshield: another boring night of speed management. He watched the warm, orange sunset as the cars zoomed down the road one by one, slouching a bit on the grey leather seats and resting his eyes for a little as he reveled in the symphony of white noise which the car’s functions created. The rush of the air conditioner, the hum of the engine; all was bliss, until his drifting off was interrupted by a voice coming from his right.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yo Max, we got a speeder!&amp;quot; the person next to Max perked, shaking him to emphasize the urgency. He opened his eyes and looked at the speeding radar, opening his mouth as he saw a staggering 60MPH flash on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eugh, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn’t want to have to do this again…” he sighed, putting his face into his hands and slowly sliding them down. “Rules are rules though, so we’ve got to pull them over. Let’s get going.” Max looked once more towards his right before beginning the chase, nodding at his recently appointed police deputy and good friend, Macy. The pair has an inseparable bond, which was why Max decided to request her to become his deputy after he was promoted to sheriff. She was a short, dark-skinned woman of African-American descent, whose black hair was extremely short and shaven on the sides, trimmed shortly on top. Her eyes shined blue, and she always wore a smile on her well-rounded face. She was slightly chubby, but not extremely overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She muted the radar so it would stop beeping and turned on the car’s built-in siren. Max put on his seatbelt, hit the gas pedal, and swerved out onto the road from their hiding place in a chaotic flurry of movements. The sirens of the car screamed doom for the driver of the red Subaru in front of them as they got closer and closer to the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max ordered Macy to begin jotting down their plate numbers as they tailed behind them at roughly the same speed they were traveling at. She leaned over at the dashboard, squinting at the numbers as she wrote them down untidily on a notepad. As soon as she finished, the car began to slow down, eventually halting its movements and pulling over to the side of the road. Max too stopped his car, pulling up right behind the Subaru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Should I go up there, or?” asked an inquisitive Macy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max adjusted his glasses as he prepared to get himself out of the car. “No worries, I’ll do it myself. Doesn’t seem to be a big issue since there’s… well, only one guy in there. I’ll be back in a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got out of the car, and began to walk towards the car slowly. As he got to it, he wrung his hands tentatively and peered into the vehicle, scanning it for the presence of a weapon. He saw none, so he lowered himself to be leveled with the driver. He knocked on the window, signaling them to roll it down, revealing a flustered, young teenager who was nervously clutching the driver’s wheel as he faced an indifferent Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey man, do you know why I pulled you over?&amp;quot; Max asked, still unsure of how old the kid was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look s-sir, I&#039;m &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; sorry. I-I had no id-idea how fast I was going, I… I slept in, and I&#039;m going to b-be late to work, this just keeps getting worse, I-I… Please don&#039;t give me a ticket, oh man, m-my parents are gonna ground me for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; the teen pleaded. Max nodded sympathetically, knowing the feeling of his situation all too well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You were going 60 on a 45,&amp;quot; Max replied. The kid put his head in his hands, further bubbling the guilt in Max’s consciousness. &amp;quot;Hey man, it&#039;s alright though, we all have our moments. If you hand me your license and registration, I&#039;ll get this thing done quickly and let you off with less of a consequence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, h-here&#039;s my license.&amp;quot; The kid stuttered between shallow breaths. He reached into his glove box, sifting through multiple heaps of different papers and junk to find it. After he found the papers and license he was looking for, he handed them to Max, who thanked him before making his way back to the car. He sat back onto the seats, letting out a fresh sigh of relief that it was just a trigger-happy teen, and not a raging drunkard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was quick,” Macy said, as surprised as he was. “Who was it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Some kid who got a bit too happy with the gas. He seemed genuine to me, I’ll probably just let him off with a warning; I can’t bring myself to give a ticket to someone in a situation I’ve been in myself countless times,&amp;quot; Max replied, logging the kid’s information into the system. As he was doing so, Macy’s police radio beeped loudly, signaling an incoming transmission from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, sheriff? Sheriff, you there? Over,&amp;quot; a crackly voice called, sounding slightly distressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is Deputy Ross speaking; Sheriff Blackfield is busy at the current moment. What do you all need? Over,&amp;quot; Macy replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, uh, you two need to get over here &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. Someone called for a welfare check, and… the guy’s uh… missing. Over.&amp;quot; The police radio beeped once more as Macy’s eyes widened slightly at what was uttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max, get this done quickly, we need to get going, &lt;em&gt;pronto&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; she exclaimed to Max, also distressed now. Max nodded finishing the last of his routine tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kid’s good, let me just let him off, I’ll be back soon. In the meantime, get this guy’s address and input it onto the GPS so we can get going ASAP,” Max ordered. He got back out of the car, and hurriedly walked towards the distressed teen, placing the documents back into his shaky hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright kid, we’ve got to scram now, so luckily for you, I’m just gonna let you off with a warning. Is that understood?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, thank you so much, sir. I&#039;ll be sure to be more wary about my speed next time,&amp;quot; he sighed in relief. “Thank you so much once again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No problem, kid. Stay safe, and have a nice night.” Max replied abruptly, hastily running back to the car, and practically jumping inside of it. He briefly glanced at the GPS before putting the car into gear, putting in all the required effort he could to get there as soon as possible. It was not long before they arrived in the neighborhood in which the house was located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, what exactly happened? Did the dude just…” Max made a ‘poof’ sound, throwing one of his hands to the side as he briefly looked towards Macy for an answer. She shrugged at him as they pulled into the driveway of a dirty, decrepit-looking yellow house, which looked as if it hadn’t been pressure washed in the last few months. Max got out of his car, putting one foot onto the cracked pavement, and then the other, as he and Macy dashed to the house’s front door — which was flung wide open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, is anyone home?&amp;quot; Max called out as he walked into the house with Macy following suit. He heard a muffled voice shouting down from the what he presumed to be the basement, so they quickly ran down the stairs to find the source of it. They reached the bottom, looking around the dark environment which now surrounded them. It was entirely silent, save only for the very annoying buzzing of a set of fluorescent lights which were plastered on the ceiling. Their only purpose seemed to be annoying him, for they were so dim that they served no practical use other than creating white noise. The wallpaper was old and tacky, and it had mold growing on several parts of it. Several piles of cluttered junk were scattered throughout the floor, which made it borderline impossible to navigate the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the duo heard footsteps dashing towards them. Max pulled out his baton, readying himself for what was to come, only to find out it was one of his co-workers, Aaron, who looked to be flustered and panicked until he saw Max. He was very short and scrawny, looking to be no more than 150 pounds. He had long, red, curly hair and glasses. His eyes were dark green, and his face was nothing but skin and bone. Max was always perplexed at how he made it past initial police training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, you’ve finally arrived, sheriff!” he said, putting away a baton which was identical to Max’s. “Excuse the, err, hostility. I always try to be prepared for any situations that may arise…” he paused for a moment, catching his breath. He shook himself out of the brief trance and continued. “I did hear your voice though, so this may just have been a force of habit, heh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never mind that, Aaron, what the heck is going on here?” asked Max, raising one of his eyebrows at his co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was called up here for a welfare check, but when I came in, I saw that the entire house was just… empty. I had no clue on what I was supposed to do when I saw that, so I called you two on the police radio,” Aaron rambled, pausing to catch his breath several times mid-sentence, seemingly forgetting to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, that’s odd to say the least,” replied Max, readjusting his glasses. “Let’s do another sweep of the place before we head back; I’d rather not go through the circus of a missing person report.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy and Aaron nodded, splitting up to cover more ground efficiently. It was not long before they lost each other in the piles of junk, all desperately moving around the magnitude of objects that were in the basement, in the ludicrous hope of possibly finding the man in his own mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy was the one searching the most frantically for him. She knew not the reason of why she was doing so, but she persisted with vigor to try and find the man, determined to find him no matter what it took. Eventually she got agitated at the fact that she was simply not able to find him, taking her anger out on the basement itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design here is atrocious, and this deadbeat can’t be bothered to at least clean the place up a bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s been gone a whole year now… my gosh, why are these lights here, they should be in a school or office. And why are they so… loud? I can’t… I can’t…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t take this anymore! Gah!” she shouted in frustration, finally voicing her thoughts out loud, quickly clasping her hands onto her mouth at the revelation of her sudden outburst. Now that she stood there, she noticed that she hadn’t heard from Max in a while now. She decided to call for him to see if he’d made any progress on the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yo, Max!&amp;quot; she called out. “Did you find anything worth noting down?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response. She walked towards the area where she saw him searching last. No noises other than the buzzing could be heard, which got continuously louder as time went on. She was fully concerned now; how could someone get lost in a basement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max!&amp;quot; she called out once more, her voice quavering. “Stop messing around, this isn’t funny. Cut it out!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distant laugh erupted from Max, barely audible over the buzzing of the lights. He was saying something, but she couldn’t fathom what it was over the sound of the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand what you’re saying, can’t we just turn the lights off so I can understand you better?” Macy yelled out in confusion. This time, not even that distant mumbling could be heard. “Max?!” she called out once more, even more worried than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She searched more frantically now, this time for Max, and not the fool who’d gotten her into this situation in the first place. Her search was fruitless however: Max was nowhere to be seen. On the verge of tears, she called out even louder and more passionately than before, her heart beating rapidly as she felt faint from the stress of the situation. He couldn’t have gotten buried under the junk, right? Even for a klutz like him it was unlikely to happen… but if that was the case, &lt;em&gt;where was he&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;MAX!&amp;quot; she cried out, louder than ever before. “WHERE ARE YOU?!” she screamed as a tear cascaded onto her cheek. No response once again, much to her dismay. The buzzing began to overload her ears, replacing all sounds around her with the dreadful white noise she had gotten accustomed to as of late. She hyperventilated as she frantically looked around the room in search of Max, her mind already presuming the worst possibilities as fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noise was silenced when she felt a touch to her shoulders, jolting her out of the moment as she turned around to face a worried Aaron. She was about to speak, when the fluorescent light above them suddenly went out with a small bang and the sound of glass shattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Woah, what on Earth was that?!” Aaron exclaimed, shook from what had just happened. He cringed in slight pain as a shard of glass sliced open a part of his arm. He couldn’t tell if Macy was injured due to the darkness in the room and her current hysteria. He turned on his flashlight, illuminating her sobbing mess of a face, as they stood there in silence, both breathing heavily in shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A-Aaron,” Macy whispered through shaky breaths, “I-I…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on? You were screaming like crazy for Ma- I mean, Sheriff Blackfield. Speaking of him, where is he?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy did not have the energy to reply to him. She began to cry when she realized that, just like the prior inhabitant of the house, her friend had suddenly disappeared. She began irrationally sifting through all the junk in the basement in an irregular fit of rage, still clinging onto the slight possibility that Max was simply buried under all of it. With adrenaline rushing through her veins, she threw various objects behind her with near inhuman strength, frantically looking for Max with feverish determination in her eyes. And yet, even after practically removing the entire room’s junk, she could not find him. She cried even harder at this revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, wait, did… did he disappear &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;?”&amp;quot; Aaron asked, his voice quavering just like hers did earlier. Macy looked at him, half-heartedly nodding at him and continuing to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could… how could this happen?” Macy asked to no one in particular. “I-I walked around a bit in this &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; basement to search for th-them a-and the next thing I know he-he’s gone, just like that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron looked at her, suddenly opening his eyes widely as if he had made a startling revelation. “Wait, try to call him, maybe you can find him with that!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as he finished speaking, she ran up the stairs, almost falling multiple times as she made her way to the car which her phone was in. She opened the door, grabbing her phone from the seat on which she’d left it on, and punched Max’s number into it. The phone began to ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; Max&#039;s voice spoke loud and clear through the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max!&amp;quot; Macy screamed. &amp;quot;Where are yo-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ha! Just kidding! This is a voicemail. I’m really sorry I missed your call. Just leave me a message, and I&#039;ll try to get back to you as soon as I can,&amp;quot; the voice said, cutting Macy off. Aaron walked out of the front door as well, catching up to the sobbing police deputy, who was slumped over in her car with her head on the dashboard. Aaron walked up to her, his brow furrowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Macy, I&amp;#8212;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know he’s there somewhere!” she cried. “People don’t just… disappear like that, th-they have to go somewhere, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She leapt out of her seat, shoving Aaron to the ground as she darted back into the house, running full speed into the basement. She went back to the place where she’d last heard Max, digging again through the heaps of garbage, tears streaming down her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Macy!&amp;quot; Aaron called out to her, walking back down into the basement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy didn&#039;t know why she was crying so much. She wasn’t thinking straight — how could she? The buzzing of the lights grew louder in her ears once more as she continued to sift through the piles of junk. Louder and louder it got, disorienting her as the room began to twist and spin around her, causing her to get lost in her own dizziness. The buzzing got all the more louder, continuing to—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hold on,&lt;/em&gt; she thought to herself. &lt;em&gt;Didn’t the lights…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lost her balance, disrupting the thought as she fell down. She tried to lean on the wall beside her for support, but found that instead, her hand had somehow… phased through the nasty wall entirely. She gasped as she realized what had just happened, halting her crying immediately as all the noise in the room defaulted to the overwhelming buzzing once more. She tried to pull her hand out of the wall in a panicked rush, growing more distressed by the second. She began to hyperventilate as her senses began to get overwhelmed; Her ears began getting overpowered by the roaring hum-buzz of the lights, her eyes began to get blurry as the room spun in circles, her nose got tingly from a sudden horrible smell, her tongue felt numb by the taste of the same odor, and her hand was stuck inside of a wall. The walls of the room began to close in on her as the room grew smaller and smaller, and the buzzing grew louder and louder, almost deafening her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the walls closed in on her fully, her last thought was of Max, and how she may have just found out what had happened to him… She closed her eyes, bracing herself for whatever lied beyond the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy heard nothing but the overpowering buzzing of the lights she had been in the presence of for so long. She looked around her, observing nothing but a dark void in every single area around her. Flashes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/blue-channel&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; began to spark like bolts of lightning around her. She felt a sickening feeling of reminiscence coursing through her body, as if she remembered this place but couldn&#039;t put her finger on it. She was unsure what was happening to her: Had she died? Had she arrived into the great beyond? Was this what awaited her after death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These thoughts were interrupted as she suddenly found herself on an ancient carpet, which looked like it was several decades past its last cleaning. She got up, groaning in disgust as she felt the moisture of the carpet on her skin. She blinked a few times as she got used to the new environment around her, still slightly disoriented from her previous experience. She could make out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;large, empty office room&lt;/a&gt;, which had mono-yellow wallpaper plastered all over it. There were also perfectly symmetrical rows of those same obnoxious fluorescent lights on the ceiling, which were not dissimilar to the ones from the basement. Disgusting, tacky, ugly; in combo with the equally nasty carpet and those dang lights, it did not help the room&#039;s first impression on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; she whispered to herself, squinting at the sudden change in lighting. She began to chuckle slightly in relief. She wasn&#039;t dead after all; it was just some secret room in the basement which she had found herself in. She stood up and turned around the corner, half-expecting Max to be there waiting for her with the missing man right next to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her optimism faded instantly when she found that the room did not end as she made her way around the corner, rather, the room simply led into another identical one. The wet carpet, tacky walls, noisy lights: It was entirely the same, save for the layout itself. She rushed to the other end of the room, panicked at what other discoveries she would make. To her horror, she found out that even this wasn&#039;t the only duplicate room, no, several rooms awaited her through what now made itself clear to be a maze, each one the same as the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where&amp;#8230; am I?&amp;quot; she muttered, suddenly feeling the gravity of her situation hit her. &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; she said a bit more loudly than before, hearing her voice reverberate around the halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-12&quot;&gt;Howling&lt;/a&gt;, coming from a few rooms down. Her eyes widened in shock, as the realization that she was probably not alone dawned on her. She bolted away from the howling, running through room after room as she tried to search for an exit from the increasingly terrifying place. The moist carpet squelched beneath her feet with every rushed step that she took, barely audible over the hum-buzz of the fluorescent lights. Eventually, she could run no more, so she decided to lay down on the ground as she huffed and panted. Her senses were entirely overloaded: Her eyes could not handle the light, her ears could not handle the buzzing, her nose could not handle the rancid smell&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She truly couldn&#039;t rest in this place as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pulled out her phone, checking if she had any form of a signal which she could use to call for help. Her reception was completely blank, not much to her surp-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notification popped up at the top of her screen, alerting her that there was an open &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-21&quot;&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; network which she could connect to. Astonished, she tapped on it, and was taken to the Wi-Fi settings option where she could connect to the signal in question. The name of the Wi-Fi was completely random; a mess of letters and numbers jumbled up together with no form or semblance of any word she knew. She tapped on it, hands quivering, and was relieved to find that there was no password which she had to input to connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that she had a stable connection, she immediately began to work away at establishing where she was. She opened google maps to find that, much to her confusion, she was located several miles away from good old Florida; right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. She didn&#039;t even have the time to act confused about it either, as the Wi-Fi signal cut out shortly after she made this revelation, rendering the app unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seriously?&amp;quot; she mumbled to herself. &amp;quot;What the heck is going on with this signal&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She checked for it once more, and found that it was entirely gone. She turned the phone on and off again, and found it back at four bars not long after. Mere seconds later, it fluctuated down to two bars, jumping from bar to bar faster than a ping pong ball in the middle of a heated game of table tennis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided it was better than nothing, and used the opportunity to call for help. She opened her contacts list, pressing Aaron’s name. She put the phone to her ear as the call attempted to connect, waiting to hear the ring. She perked up in excitement after hearing a noise from the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, but unfortunately your call could not be completed at this time. If this problem persists, please call your service provider at-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sighed ended the call, knowing that attempting to call anyone was useless without a stable signal. She gave up on the infuriatingly fickle Wi-Fi, putting her phone back in her pocket. She’d never seen her internet connection fluctuate that quickly, but it wasn&#039;t the strangest thing she&#039;d encountered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided to just further explore the new environment she was in for now, attempting to figure out &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; exactly she actually was. She walked through the rooms for hours on end, documenting all of her findings on her phone&#039;s notes app, whilst also trying to maintain her phone&#039;s battery as best as she could. It was not long before she began to consider giving up, as the repetitiveness of the rooms had begun to get to her, when suddenly she found a room that was different from the ones she&#039;d come across before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room had the same washed decor as the other rooms, save for the fact that on one side of the room, a regular-looking door stood proudly amidst the endless sea of mono-yellow. Normally, she wouldn&#039;t give it much attention; it was a regular door, why would she? Except, this regular door was something truly extraordinary in the circumstances she found herself in. She put her ear to the door, hearing nothing but ominous silence on the other side. Was it just a new gateway to another set of rooms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided to open it nonetheless, a final bout of hesitation hitting her just before she turned the knob. &lt;em&gt;What if it&#039;s not just rooms beyond this door? What if there&#039;s&amp;#8230; worse places to be trapped in than here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually however, curiosity killed the cat. If she was going to die, so be it; she was tired of the monotonous rooms anyways. She turned the knob, slowly opening the door and poking her head in, surprised to find that there was a&amp;#8230; comfortable looking lounge inside of it? Was she hallucinating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls were painted a startling shade of titanium white, and several pieces of blue furniture was strewn about the room: Couches, tables; even a blue TV. The carpets were a shade of dark grey, which was a vast improvement over the carpets in the other rooms. There were also pictures, canvases, and murals hung on the walls of the lounge, all depicting a blue parrot. The room itself was also something to behold: it was gargantuan, with several other corridors and doors present in it, which she supposed lead to other rooms. Odd was the only word she could use to describe the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked in silently, closing the door behind her and creating a small echo in the room. She cautiously made her way around the room, exploring several areas of it in search of possible supplies. Her eyes widened as she saw a mini-fridge in one part of the room, and she quickly ran to it as silently as she could, throwing open the door in ravenous hunger. Her stomach did double-flips as she saw that it was filled to the brim with delicacies and supplies, and her mouth began to water at the sight of her favourite food: Cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took out the plate of cheese and began to devour it like a rabid dog, not even allowing the food to touch her taste buds as she satisfied all of her hunger. After she was done with the cheese, she turned once more to the fridge in search of something to drink. Her eyes moved towards a set of thermoses at the end of the fridge, which she opened to find that they were filled with water. She put her lips onto the brim of the thermos, taking in its odd vanilla scent, and brought it up, guzzling the precious liquid into he-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;BLEUGH, what on Earth?!&amp;quot; she said as she spat out the water, an utterly disgusted look plastered on her face. She gagged at the taste, which was reminiscent of almonds. She hated almonds, but despite that fact, she still felt satisfied with the drink, fulfilled by it. She logged this observation along with the entire lounge area with the rest of her notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-way through logging said notes, she heard the doorknob of the door jiggle from the other side of it. She dived behind one of the couches in one swift motion, hiding from whoever — or whatever — was coming from the other side. She watched as the door opened, and a crowd of people clad in blue robes made their way into the lounge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imma telling you, I walk back in here to get a snack, and like, boom, nothin&#039;s left of the wall, s&#039;all just a big black void,&amp;quot; a female voice ranted in anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy watched as a woman, who wore loose grey leggings and a grey jacket, walked into the room. Her hair was extremely long and greasy, and her skin looked particularly oily and disgusting. She had hazel eyes with freckles all over her face. It was obvious she didn’t take much pride in her appearance or sanitation. A black, inky substance was leaking from her mouth, dripping onto the floor in giant dollops, staining the gray carpet. The sight of this caused Macy to feel a bit sick to her stomach. She seemed to be the only one of the bunch that wasn&#039;t wearing a blue robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair, this better not be one of your manic overreactions,&amp;quot; a parrot-like voice &amp;#8212; no, a &lt;em&gt;bird&lt;/em&gt; cawed? Macy stared in shock as a bird like the one depicted in the paintings flew into the room alongside the woman. It perched on the woman&#039;s &amp;#8212; who she presumed was Sinclair &amp;#8212; shoulder, as the last members of the group made their way into the room, shutting the door behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It isn&#039;t, I &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt;. Check it out, it&#039;s right over there, see?&amp;quot; she replied, pointing towards the end of one of the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair, it&#039;s probably just a wall some moron painted black. That ink you insist on drinking is probably just getting to your head,&amp;quot; a strange man said. His voice sounded fragile, feeble, old, pretty similar to what she imagined a mummy would sound like. Macy tried to get a better look at his face, but she couldn&#039;t make out any of its details. Instead, she focused on the more esoteric features of the man; mainly his downright bizarre clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the rest of his companions, he wore a blue cloak, but unlike them, he wore a goofy mask that was similar to the beak of the parrot she had seen earlier. Its beak opened and closed with each movement of his mouth. He also had a comically large blade strapped onto his back, which was blue like the rest of his clothing, and it looked &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; sharp, which she found concerning. He wore feather-covered gloves, the only parts of his body which she could actually see due to the cloak which he wore. As he took steps across the room, she saw flashes of his feet, which looked like&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bird&amp;#8230; talons?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She snickered at the man&#039;s ridiculous costume, but immediately clasped her mouth as she realised the mistake she&#039;d just made. &lt;em&gt;A fatal mistake&lt;/em&gt;, she thought to herself as the man stopped dead in his tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone, halt.&amp;quot; He glared at the crowd to convey his seriousness. The chatter amongst the group stopped immediately, all eyes turning towards the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is it, Father Bluebird?&amp;quot; the blue parrot squawked in reply. The man remained silent for a moment, holding his index finger up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are not alone in the lounge. There is a foreign presence with us here,&amp;quot; he replied. Tension filled the room as he uttered the last of these words, as silence overcame all of those in the group. Macy slowed her breathing to further her chances of staying hidden, which was an ironic contrast to her heart, which was beating with the same ferocity of a hummingbird&#039;s wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, she thought that she had outsmarted them, and that she had actually not been caught whatsoever. However, no news is certainly not always good news; just a few seconds after the thought had passed through her head, she saw the masked man&#039;s head appear over the couch, peering down at her with contempt as she panicked anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, please! I can ex-&amp;quot; Macy stammered before being cut off by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew it! Someone was here all along!&amp;quot; the old man interrupted, suddenly bursting into maniacal laughter which escaped through his wrinkled lips. His expression turned sour as quickly as he had burst into laughter, and he hastily pulled her up opposite to him. His face was entirely covered by the mask at the bottom, but nothing covered the cold, dark eyes that pierced through the fibre of her being, sending shivers down her spine. He reached for his blade, drawing it from his back with unnatural, inhuman swiftness; truly, a sight to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four foot long blade, now unrestrained by the narrow case which held it, glinted under the dazzling lights of the room. The coloration of it was shockingly blue, and it was encrusted with several intricately crafted gold markings, which lined the edges of the blade&#039;s finely forged metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father Bluebird lunged towards her, putting the forte of the blade right up to her neck, effectively trapping her where she stood. Macy tried to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth to do so, he put the sword closer to her neck as if to tell her to stop speaking if she valued her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jerry,&amp;quot; he said as he looked at the bird, venom lacing his voice. &amp;quot;Do I have your permission to kill this intruder?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. She was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to let it all end like this. She kicked him in the calf, causing the old man to lose his balance and collapse, dropping the blade from his grasp. Macy, now loose from the trap, punched the man in his gut. Contrary to what she thought would happen, he sprang up from the ground, lunging at her anew. She attempted to punch him once more, but he was prepared this time, catching her first with his feathery hand in midair. Macy tried to use her other hand to knock him out, but it was futile, as it underwent the same fate as her other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pushed Macy until her back was plastered to a wall, ramming her with his head in the process like a bull would&#039;ve. He then flipped her over his head, and slammed her onto the carpeted ground, knocking the wind straight out of her and leaving her gasping for air. He swooped to the ground to grab his blade once more, and held the pointy tip to her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How- how did yo-&amp;quot; gasped Macy in shock, barely able to utter the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will ask once more, hopefully for the last time: do I have the permission to end this pathetic worm&#039;s life?&amp;quot; the old man snarled through clenched teeth, this time not taking his eyes off of Macy. The bird flew off of Sinclair&#039;s shoulder, perching on Macy&#039;s chest and maintaining eye contact with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is your name, young one?&amp;quot; the bird cawed quietly, its voice sounding all too similar to what a stereotypical pirate parrot would’ve. The man moved his blade away as the bird sat on the chest, retracting it meekly as if scared that he had hurt &amp;#8212; or offended &amp;#8212; the bird in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, can I ask just one teensy tiny question: What in the ever-loving heck is going on here?!&amp;quot; yelled Macy, ignoring the question. She flicked the bird off of her chest, causing it to lose its balance and be pushed back. The cloaked people began muttering in shock and disapproval. Some showed immediate hostility to her in the form of jeers and boos as she stood up from her position on the ground, backing away from the armed man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How dare you!&amp;quot; screamed Father Bluebird in a fervent display of loyalty to the bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No! None of this nonsense! I have questions I want answered, and you better be able to answer them!&amp;quot; Macy threatened, revealing her taser and aiming it at the old man. The crowd of people gasped at her boldness, the murmurs getting louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is this blasphemy?&amp;quot; the old man growled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wake up in an utterly disgusting room, and then I get out of it to see there&#039;s more of it, and even more the further I explored. Did one of you maniacs actually go through the trouble of filling each one of them with those sickening walls, or those revolting carpets, or- or- or those STUPID BLOODY LIGHTS!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her screaming silenced all the murmurs that had been circulating amongst the group. &amp;quot;I walk around for hours and hours on end, to end up here with you weirdos. She&#039;s got ink gushing out of her mouth like a waterfall, this guy&#039;s waving a giant sword at me and threatening to kill me, and I don&#039;t even want to get started on your obsession with this &lt;em&gt;talking bird&lt;/em&gt;, who, seems to be the most normal out of you all!&amp;quot; she breathed in deeply, and exhaled it out slowly, calming herself down. &amp;quot;What in Pete’s sake is going on here? And where&#039;s Max?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answers. This only made her more frustrated, but she kept it inside this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll ask you once more, hopefully for the last time. What is your name?&amp;quot; the bird cawed calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Macy.&amp;quot; she replied, breathing heavily from her outburst. The bird flapped its wings, flying into the air and landing on a nearby bird perch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you&#039;re new to The Backrooms, huh?&amp;quot; it squawked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What on earth are you talking about?&amp;quot; Macy asked through clenched teeth, still holding her taser at the armed man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Congratulations then, you&#039;ve made it outside of reality itself. I&#039;m Jerry, or as some refer to me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7&quot;&gt;Entity 7&lt;/a&gt;. Although, I do prefer the former, so I&#039;d rather you not refer to me as Entity 7.&amp;quot; Jerry replied, bowing its little body as it spoke. Macy blinked a few times in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hold on, there&#039;s- there&#039;s &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt;?!&amp;quot; she exclaimed in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, yes, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;Meggies&lt;/a&gt; refer to those of us which are native to this realm as &#039;entities&#039;, and they&#039;ve logged hundreds of us in their silly database. I&#039;ve always abhorred how they group me in with the rest of the creatures here, as if I&#039;m anything like them! Bah, regardless of that, all you need to know for now is that you&#039;ve escaped the bounds of reality, and you&#039;ve now entered what are known as The Backrooms. Not many people are on my good side, but I like you.&amp;quot; Jerry cooed, a mischievous grin on its face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#8230; need a minute. To process all this- this&amp;#8230; you know&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Macy said, lowering her taser and throwing her hands around the room. She fell backward onto one of the sofas, a look of shock and confusion all over her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oookayyy, now that we&#039;re done with that little production, can I request that you all just, follow me around so I can show you what I was talking about?&amp;quot; yelled Sinclair, ink still dripping from her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine Sinclair. You may lead the way.&amp;quot; Jerry squawked, turning to Macy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why don&#039;t you come with us?&amp;quot; it said, jumping onto her shoulders and bobbing its head forward, beckoning her to move forward with the rest of the group without giving her a chance to refuse or accept its offer. She tensed a little, still shook by her experience, but obeyed anyways as she walked after the crowd of people which was lead by Sinclair. Father Bluebird occasionally glared at her throughout the whole procession, which solidified her feeling that she&#039;d already made an enemy in this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They walked down the corridors, turning through several hallways of rooms which the people probably lived in. They reached the end of the hallway which Sinclair wanted to show them, where one of the white walls was painted an eigengrau shade of grey. Sinclair smirked as the group looked in confusion at the sight before them, still confused as to why Sinclair was making such a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair, you idiot,&amp;quot; Father Bluebird grumbled. He walked through the crowd, purposefully bumping Macy with his shoulder on his path towards the front of the group. &amp;quot;You&#039;ve been here for how long now? And you still have no clue how this place works?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you talking about?&amp;quot; Sinclair asked, slightly angry at his sarcasm. &amp;quot;Don&#039;t give me that sass you bag of dust; I know how this place works as much as you do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do I need to spell it out to you?!&amp;quot; the old man replied at this, raising his voice. &amp;quot;You see, in The Backrooms, you can go through walls sometimes. Walls go dark sometimes, meaning you can clip through them. Is that not truly wonderful?&amp;quot; he said in a condescending tone, making several gestures with his hand to exaggerate his point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No! They don&#039;t just up and decide one day that they&#039;re gonna turn into the void, clippable walls look different than this!&amp;quot; Sinclair stammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father Bluebird rolled his eyes. &amp;quot;Watch.&amp;quot; he grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He approached the darkness, and proceeded to stick his feathery hand into it, looking back at Sinclair with a smug look barely inferable on his covered face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;B-but&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair, my hand has just clipped through the wall. You see? This isn&#039;t anyth-&amp;quot; Father Bluebird stopped his sarcastic comments as he pulled his arm out of the wall, only to find that it was gone; cut right off where his hand had not entered the void. The tip of his arm was gone now, replaced by a flat, clean cut, which showed his bones and muscles in full display. He screamed as blood began to spray out of the now exposed wound on his arm like a fountain, drenching the members and staining the walls with the spurts of crimson liquid. The group was lit ablaze with distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my gosh, we need to help him!&amp;quot; Macy cried, her police instincts instantly kicking in. She threw her vest and top off, which left her in nothing but her sleeveless undershirt. She quickly grabbed the man&#039;s bleeding arm and tied her shirt around it, tightening it as much as she physically could. The blue shirt was immediately covered in scarlet red stains, which combined with the color of the shirt to turn it a deep shade of purple. She squeezed his forearm with her left hand to apply further pressure, holding the shirt tight with the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; Father Bluebird yelled through pained screams. He tried to escape her grasp, fighting against her grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Helping you, moron! Quit struggling!&amp;quot; Macy exclaimed in distress. &amp;quot;Is there like, a hospital or something in this place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nay,&amp;quot; cried Jerry. &amp;quot;The only medical assistance you can get here is from the Meggies. Hurry up now, stop the bleeding!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why can’t we just ask them, then?” Macy replied in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, my dear, we aren’t on very good terms with them. I predict Father Bluebird’s very presence among them would cause them to all run in fear, if not attempt to detain him.” Jerry sighed, looking slightly concerned at what this meant for his most devoted follower’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Darn it!&amp;quot; Macy sighed, frustrated by the revelation. She put Father Bluebird on one of the nearby couches, squeezing his arm to apply the pressure needed to aid in the halting of the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, like, what is this thing?&amp;quot; Sinclair asked, looking at the void. She reached into her jacket pocket, and pulled out a small flashlight. She shined it at the void, but the patch was not illuminated, retaining its dark form despite the fact that light was being shined directly onto it. Sinclair, still seemingly confused by this, grabbed a pillow from a nearby couch and threw it at the void. It was immediately swallowed up, with no sign of returning any time soon. She stood there, as if expecting something else to happen, but just like Father Bluebird&#039;s hand, it was gone. This confused her greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned back to face Macy and Father Bluebird, who was currently writhing on the couch in agony. The bleeding had slowed down, but the pain was still extreme, and he had lost his color, turning a ghostly shade of white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair,&amp;quot; The bird commanded. &amp;quot;Watch over Father Bluebird. I need to speak with Macy.&amp;quot; Jerry cawed. Sinclair immediately followed the order, sitting down onto the couch next to the old man, comforting him and applying pressure like Macy had been doing earlier. In the meantime, Macy followed an airborne Jerry back into the main room, who stood on a closed box in a corner when they arrived there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is something about you which I find most endearing.&amp;quot; Jerry said, intrigue in its voice as it flashed her a cunning glance. Macy itched her bare shoulder, looking at Jerry as if being a talking parrot wasn&#039;t the craziest thing it’d done today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; Macy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&#039;s a reason I have not put you under my control yet,&amp;quot; Jerry cawed. &amp;quot;The reason they all follow me with such vehement dedication is not due to their own vocation, but rather&amp;#8230; one of my powers. I can persuade people into doing what I want, manipulate them into becoming but pawns on my chessboard, and if someone gets close to me&amp;#8230; let&#039;s just say that they&#039;ll be a part of my group for a long, long, time: Permanently, and irreversibly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy gulped as soon as Jerry finished its monologue. She felt less and less safe around the bird as the minutes went by. Jerry seemed to notice her fear, and it was relishing every ounce of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not look so scared; the power is not necessarily constant among all my followers &amp;#8212; I have spared you from it after all. In all actuality&amp;#8230; I have an offer for you, my child.&amp;quot; Jerry squeezed its talons on the handle of the box, and flew into the air, opening it. Macy craned her neck forward to see what was inside, and found in it a beautiful golden robe, not dissimilar to the other members&#039; robes in make, but all the much different in the aura which it gave off. Macy looked up at Jerry, who now flapped onto its perch next to her ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is a prophecy; one that foretells that a newcomer to The Backrooms shall become my right hand upon arriving to me and making their first impressions on me. The criteria which you fit is beyond you &amp;#8212; I cannot begin to explain my thought process in the first place &amp;#8212; but, you will do great with me, we shall bring an end to pain and suffering in The Backrooms, and perhaps some day, find an exit, bring salvation to the people here. Perhaps you will consider my methods inhumane at first, but you will understand in due time that my ideals are for the greater good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird stared at Macy, who was now even more confused than she was before. &amp;quot;But&amp;#8230; why me? I know that you said that your criteria is a secret, but why did you not choose someone like Father Bluebird instead of me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no, trust me; I have considered Father Bluebird before, they are my most dedicated follower by far. However, Father Bluebird is simply not the right one. There is something about you in particular which drives me to believe that you are the correct choice. I have no reason to support this belief other than my own instincts, but&amp;#8230; I think I have finally made my choice, after all these centuries of waiting for you, dear chosen one, to come to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, are you saying&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Macy muttered, perplexed by Jerry&#039;s monologue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes dear, you are now the Chosen One, the new highest member of the group.&amp;quot; Jerry smiled, its black beak rising to its cheeks. Macy&#039;s breath began to get shaky as she stared at the bird, any shred of belief that the bird was not a megalomaniac shattering right in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But&amp;#8230; what if I refuse? What if I don&#039;t want to be a part of this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry turned its head sideways, looking at her intently as its expression turned sour. &amp;quot;The option for me to make you just like them is still on the table, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy remembered what it had told her it could do just a few minutes ago. She did not want to be made a puppet of, but she also did not want to have to be a part of the bird&#039;s followers. She considered turning around and running straight to the exit, but she had no idea how far Jerry&#039;s powers could reach. Further pondering brought her to the conclusion that even if she did escape, she&#039;d just end up back where she started, in the endless labyrinth of yellow rooms which she&#039;d escaped from out of sheer luck. Who knows how long it would take her to find someone else, if ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded that it would be best to stay with Jerry. Maniacal and utterly despicable, but also safe and secure. Macy bent down and reached into the box, unfolding the cloak and watching it shimmer in the light as if it was actually made of gold. White markings lined it along the sleeves, edges, and seams. It was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go ahead, try it on.&amp;quot; Jerry squawked. Macy raised the bottom of the cloak over her head, and slipped it down her body. She reached her arms into the sleeves, adjusted it over her body, and looked towards Jerry for a form of approval. It fit her perfectly, as if it was specifically tailored just for her. Maybe the bird was actually right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wow, this is&amp;#8230; glamorous. It&#039;s wonderful!&amp;quot; Macy smiled half-heartedly. She couldn&#039;t deny that the cloak looked amazing, it was just that&amp;#8230; the circumstances leading up to her getting it were &lt;em&gt;worrying&lt;/em&gt;, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to your new family, Chosen One. Welcome to the Followers of Jerry!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy smiled at it, this time a bit wider in hopes of appearing more genuine. She had already begun to doubt if this was the right course of action for her to have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weeks later&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks had passed since Macy was inaugurated as the Chosen One. At the present moment, she lay on her bed in her specially made room, utterly exhausted due to the hectic weeks that had just passed. Being the co-leader of an otherworldly cult, just as she had presumed, was as chaotic as a cult could possibly get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, Sinclair had stormed out of the room, ranting about some conspiracy related to the &amp;quot;Meggies&amp;quot; which she had yet to meet, claiming that the void that she had now obsessed with was their doing. She had even made a stereotypical conspiracy board in her room, which Macy found both concerning and absurd. Macy didn&#039;t fret however. She had been told multiple times that Sinclair was prone to doing these things, and that she would be back in due time. What was up with that nutjob anyways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her rest was cut short when she suddenly heard commotion in the lounge. She woke up and pressed her ears to the door, waiting in suspense for what was to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair! Why are you bringing lost ones into our chuch?&amp;quot; a voice exclaimed from the lobby. Macy recognized it as the voice of one of her fellow followers, Kira. She quickly retracted from the door and went to her wardrobe, in which she had her only robe hanging, miraculously having stayed clean despite its weeks without a proper washing. She put it on quickly, not caring if she looked tidy or not, and lifted her hood up as she exited the room to see what exactly all the commotion was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was beginning to feel a tiny tinge of recognition from the voice that was now speaking in the lounge, the origin of it coming very close to her fingertips before her train of thought was interrupted by a grumpy looking Father Bluebird, who was coming from the other side of the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quite rude of them to come in and make such a racket, what is going on in there?&amp;quot; he said to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure, it&#039;s probably just one of Sinclair&#039;s antic-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yo, Macy!&amp;quot; she heard Sinclair yell from the main room, interrupting her sentence mid-way through. &amp;quot;You got someone who wants to see you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From nowhere in particular, Jerry flew onto Macy&#039;s shoulder, encouraging her to continue forward. She obeyed its commands, walking into the main room with Jerry on her right shoulder as her flowery robe glittered in the rays of light cast by the lounge&#039;s overhead lights. Father Bluebird followed close behind, emerging into the room mere seconds after she did. They all looked at Sinclair, as she and the other followers bowed in Jerry&#039;s presence. The trio truly made a scene of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who did you bring this time, Sinclair?&amp;quot; Jerry squawked from atop her shoulder. Macy looked up at the people it was referring to; a group of people all clad in black polo shirts with an eagle crest on it. One of them was a tall, scrawny-looking man with glasses who&#039;s hair was blonde and curly, beautiful in its own way despite the fact it was messy and unkempt. Her eyes widened as she began to recognize the man that stood before her, tuning out all others in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could it actually be him?&lt;/em&gt; she thought to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meggies&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Father Bluebird grumbled as Macy continued to stare at the man before her agape. He seemed to be just as surprised as her, which meant only one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lowered her hood to get a better look at him, confirming to him that his suspicions had been true. For a while, everything was silent, before the man whispered one shaky word, barely able to keep his surprise intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Macy?&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

He watched the warm, orange sunset as the cars zoomed down the road one by one, slouching a bit on the grey leather seats and resting his eyes for a little as he reveled in the symphony of white noise which the car’s functions created. The rush of the air conditioner, the hum of the engine; all was bliss, until his drifting off was interrupted by a voice coming from his right. <p>&quot;Yo Max, we got a speeder!&quot; the person next to Max perked, shaking him to emphasize the urgency. He opened his eyes and looked at the speeding radar, opening his mouth as he saw a staggering 60MPH flash on the screen.</p> <p>“Eugh, I <em>really</em> didn’t want to have to do this again…” he sighed, putting his face into his hands and slowly sliding them down. “Rules are rules though, so we’ve got to pull them over. Let’s get going.” Max looked once more towards his right before beginning the chase, nodding at his recently appointed police deputy and good friend, Macy. The pair has an inseparable bond, which was why Max decided to request her to become his deputy after he was promoted to sheriff. She was a short, dark-skinned woman of African-American descent, whose black hair was extremely short and shaven on the sides, trimmed shortly on top. Her eyes shined blue, and she always wore a smile on her well-rounded face. She was slightly chubby, but not extremely overweight.</p> <p>She muted the radar so it would stop beeping and turned on the car’s built-in siren. Max put on his seatbelt, hit the gas pedal, and swerved out onto the road from their hiding place in a chaotic flurry of movements. The sirens of the car screamed doom for the driver of the red Subaru in front of them as they got closer and closer to the vehicle.</p> <p>Max ordered Macy to begin jotting down their plate numbers as they tailed behind them at roughly the same speed they were traveling at. She leaned over at the dashboard, squinting at the numbers as she wrote them down untidily on a notepad. As soon as she finished, the car began to slow down, eventually halting its movements and pulling over to the side of the road. Max too stopped his car, pulling up right behind the Subaru.</p> <p>“Should I go up there, or?” asked an inquisitive Macy.</p> <p>Max adjusted his glasses as he prepared to get himself out of the car. “No worries, I’ll do it myself. Doesn’t seem to be a big issue since there’s… well, only one guy in there. I’ll be back in a minute.”</p> <p>He got out of the car, and began to walk towards the car slowly. As he got to it, he wrung his hands tentatively and peered into the vehicle, scanning it for the presence of a weapon. He saw none, so he lowered himself to be leveled with the driver. He knocked on the window, signaling them to roll it down, revealing a flustered, young teenager who was nervously clutching the driver’s wheel as he faced an indifferent Max.</p> <p>&quot;Hey man, do you know why I pulled you over?&quot; Max asked, still unsure of how old the kid was.</p> <p>&quot;Look s-sir, I'm <em>so</em> sorry. I-I had no id-idea how fast I was going, I… I slept in, and I'm going to b-be late to work, this just keeps getting worse, I-I… Please don't give me a ticket, oh man, m-my parents are gonna ground me for <em>months</em>!&quot; the teen pleaded. Max nodded sympathetically, knowing the feeling of his situation all too well.</p> <p>&quot;You were going 60 on a 45,&quot; Max replied. The kid put his head in his hands, further bubbling the guilt in Max’s consciousness. &quot;Hey man, it's alright though, we all have our moments. If you hand me your license and registration, I'll get this thing done quickly and let you off with less of a consequence.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Alright, h-here's my license.&quot; The kid stuttered between shallow breaths. He reached into his glove box, sifting through multiple heaps of different papers and junk to find it. After he found the papers and license he was looking for, he handed them to Max, who thanked him before making his way back to the car. He sat back onto the seats, letting out a fresh sigh of relief that it was just a trigger-happy teen, and not a raging drunkard.</p> <p>&quot;That was quick,” Macy said, as surprised as he was. “Who was it?”</p> <p>&quot;Some kid who got a bit too happy with the gas. He seemed genuine to me, I’ll probably just let him off with a warning; I can’t bring myself to give a ticket to someone in a situation I’ve been in myself countless times,&quot; Max replied, logging the kid’s information into the system. As he was doing so, Macy’s police radio beeped loudly, signaling an incoming transmission from their peers.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, sheriff? Sheriff, you there? Over,&quot; a crackly voice called, sounding slightly distressed.</p> <p>&quot;This is Deputy Ross speaking; Sheriff Blackfield is busy at the current moment. What do you all need? Over,&quot; Macy replied.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, uh, you two need to get over here <em>immediately</em>. Someone called for a welfare check, and… the guy’s uh… missing. Over.&quot; The police radio beeped once more as Macy’s eyes widened slightly at what was uttered.</p> <p>&quot;Max, get this done quickly, we need to get going, <em>pronto</em>,&quot; she exclaimed to Max, also distressed now. Max nodded finishing the last of his routine tasks.</p> <p>“Kid’s good, let me just let him off, I’ll be back soon. In the meantime, get this guy’s address and input it onto the GPS so we can get going ASAP,” Max ordered. He got back out of the car, and hurriedly walked towards the distressed teen, placing the documents back into his shaky hands.</p> <p>&quot;Alright kid, we’ve got to scram now, so luckily for you, I’m just gonna let you off with a warning. Is that understood?”</p> <p>&quot;Oh, thank you so much, sir. I'll be sure to be more wary about my speed next time,&quot; he sighed in relief. “Thank you so much once again!”</p> <p>“No problem, kid. Stay safe, and have a nice night.” Max replied abruptly, hastily running back to the car, and practically jumping inside of it. He briefly glanced at the GPS before putting the car into gear, putting in all the required effort he could to get there as soon as possible. It was not long before they arrived in the neighborhood in which the house was located.</p> <p>“So, what exactly happened? Did the dude just…” Max made a ‘poof’ sound, throwing one of his hands to the side as he briefly looked towards Macy for an answer. She shrugged at him as they pulled into the driveway of a dirty, decrepit-looking yellow house, which looked as if it hadn’t been pressure washed in the last few months. Max got out of his car, putting one foot onto the cracked pavement, and then the other, as he and Macy dashed to the house’s front door — which was flung wide open.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, is anyone home?&quot; Max called out as he walked into the house with Macy following suit. He heard a muffled voice shouting down from the what he presumed to be the basement, so they quickly ran down the stairs to find the source of it. They reached the bottom, looking around the dark environment which now surrounded them. It was entirely silent, save only for the very annoying buzzing of a set of fluorescent lights which were plastered on the ceiling. Their only purpose seemed to be annoying him, for they were so dim that they served no practical use other than creating white noise. The wallpaper was old and tacky, and it had mold growing on several parts of it. Several piles of cluttered junk were scattered throughout the floor, which made it borderline impossible to navigate the place.</p> <p>Suddenly, the duo heard footsteps dashing towards them. Max pulled out his baton, readying himself for what was to come, only to find out it was one of his co-workers, Aaron, who looked to be flustered and panicked until he saw Max. He was very short and scrawny, looking to be no more than 150 pounds. He had long, red, curly hair and glasses. His eyes were dark green, and his face was nothing but skin and bone. Max was always perplexed at how he made it past initial police training.</p> <p>“Oh, you’ve finally arrived, sheriff!” he said, putting away a baton which was identical to Max’s. “Excuse the, err, hostility. I always try to be prepared for any situations that may arise…” he paused for a moment, catching his breath. He shook himself out of the brief trance and continued. “I did hear your voice though, so this may just have been a force of habit, heh.”</p> <p>“Never mind that, Aaron, what the heck is going on here?” asked Max, raising one of his eyebrows at his co-worker.</p> <p>&quot;I was called up here for a welfare check, but when I came in, I saw that the entire house was just… empty. I had no clue on what I was supposed to do when I saw that, so I called you two on the police radio,” Aaron rambled, pausing to catch his breath several times mid-sentence, seemingly forgetting to breathe.</p> <p>“Yeah, that’s odd to say the least,” replied Max, readjusting his glasses. “Let’s do another sweep of the place before we head back; I’d rather not go through the circus of a missing person report.”</p> <p>Macy and Aaron nodded, splitting up to cover more ground efficiently. It was not long before they lost each other in the piles of junk, all desperately moving around the magnitude of objects that were in the basement, in the ludicrous hope of possibly finding the man in his own mess.</p> <p>Macy was the one searching the most frantically for him. She knew not the reason of why she was doing so, but she persisted with vigor to try and find the man, determined to find him no matter what it took. Eventually she got agitated at the fact that she was simply not able to find him, taking her anger out on the basement itself.</p> <p><em>The design here is atrocious, and this deadbeat can’t be bothered to at least clean the place up a bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s been gone a whole year now… my gosh, why are these lights here, they should be in a school or office. And why are they so… loud? I can’t… I can’t…</em></p> <p>“I can’t take this anymore! Gah!” she shouted in frustration, finally voicing her thoughts out loud, quickly clasping her hands onto her mouth at the revelation of her sudden outburst. Now that she stood there, she noticed that she hadn’t heard from Max in a while now. She decided to call for him to see if he’d made any progress on the search.</p> <p>&quot;Yo, Max!&quot; she called out. “Did you find anything worth noting down?”</p> <p>No response. She walked towards the area where she saw him searching last. No noises other than the buzzing could be heard, which got continuously louder as time went on. She was fully concerned now; how could someone get lost in a basement?</p> <p>&quot;Max!&quot; she called out once more, her voice quavering. “Stop messing around, this isn’t funny. Cut it out!”</p> <p>A distant laugh erupted from Max, barely audible over the buzzing of the lights. He was saying something, but she couldn’t fathom what it was over the sound of the lights.</p> <p>“I don’t understand what you’re saying, can’t we just turn the lights off so I can understand you better?” Macy yelled out in confusion. This time, not even that distant mumbling could be heard. “Max?!” she called out once more, even more worried than before.</p> <p>She searched more frantically now, this time for Max, and not the fool who’d gotten her into this situation in the first place. Her search was fruitless however: Max was nowhere to be seen. On the verge of tears, she called out even louder and more passionately than before, her heart beating rapidly as she felt faint from the stress of the situation. He couldn’t have gotten buried under the junk, right? Even for a klutz like him it was unlikely to happen… but if that was the case, <em>where was he</em>?</p> <p>&quot;MAX!&quot; she cried out, louder than ever before. “WHERE ARE YOU?!” she screamed as a tear cascaded onto her cheek. No response once again, much to her dismay. The buzzing began to overload her ears, replacing all sounds around her with the dreadful white noise she had gotten accustomed to as of late. She hyperventilated as she frantically looked around the room in search of Max, her mind already presuming the worst possibilities as fact.</p> <p>The noise was silenced when she felt a touch to her shoulders, jolting her out of the moment as she turned around to face a worried Aaron. She was about to speak, when the fluorescent light above them suddenly went out with a small bang and the sound of glass shattering.</p> <p>“Woah, what on Earth was that?!” Aaron exclaimed, shook from what had just happened. He cringed in slight pain as a shard of glass sliced open a part of his arm. He couldn’t tell if Macy was injured due to the darkness in the room and her current hysteria. He turned on his flashlight, illuminating her sobbing mess of a face, as they stood there in silence, both breathing heavily in shock.</p> <p>“A-Aaron,” Macy whispered through shaky breaths, “I-I…”</p> <p>“What’s going on? You were screaming like crazy for Ma- I mean, Sheriff Blackfield. Speaking of him, where is he?”</p> <p>Macy did not have the energy to reply to him. She began to cry when she realized that, just like the prior inhabitant of the house, her friend had suddenly disappeared. She began irrationally sifting through all the junk in the basement in an irregular fit of rage, still clinging onto the slight possibility that Max was simply buried under all of it. With adrenaline rushing through her veins, she threw various objects behind her with near inhuman strength, frantically looking for Max with feverish determination in her eyes. And yet, even after practically removing the entire room’s junk, she could not find him. She cried even harder at this revelation.</p> <p>&quot;Wait, wait, did… did he disappear <em>too</em>?”&quot; Aaron asked, his voice quavering just like hers did earlier. Macy looked at him, half-heartedly nodding at him and continuing to cry.</p> <p>“How could… how could this happen?” Macy asked to no one in particular. “I-I walked around a bit in this <em>stupid</em> basement to search for th-them a-and the next thing I know he-he’s gone, just like that!</p> <p>Aaron looked at her, suddenly opening his eyes widely as if he had made a startling revelation. “Wait, try to call him, maybe you can find him with that!”</p> <p>As soon as he finished speaking, she ran up the stairs, almost falling multiple times as she made her way to the car which her phone was in. She opened the door, grabbing her phone from the seat on which she’d left it on, and punched Max’s number into it. The phone began to ring.</p> <p>&quot;Hello?&quot; Max's voice spoke loud and clear through the phone.</p> <p>&quot;Max!&quot; Macy screamed. &quot;Where are yo-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ha! Just kidding! This is a voicemail. I’m really sorry I missed your call. Just leave me a message, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can,&quot; the voice said, cutting Macy off. Aaron walked out of the front door as well, catching up to the sobbing police deputy, who was slumped over in her car with her head on the dashboard. Aaron walked up to her, his brow furrowed.</p> <p>&quot;Macy, I&#8212;&quot;</p> <p>“I know he’s there somewhere!” she cried. “People don’t just… disappear like that, th-they have to go somewhere, right?”</p> <p>She leapt out of her seat, shoving Aaron to the ground as she darted back into the house, running full speed into the basement. She went back to the place where she’d last heard Max, digging again through the heaps of garbage, tears streaming down her face.</p> <p>&quot;Macy!&quot; Aaron called out to her, walking back down into the basement as well.</p> <p>Macy didn't know why she was crying so much. She wasn’t thinking straight — how could she? The buzzing of the lights grew louder in her ears once more as she continued to sift through the piles of junk. Louder and louder it got, disorienting her as the room began to twist and spin around her, causing her to get lost in her own dizziness. The buzzing got all the more louder, continuing to—</p> <p><em>Hold on,</em> she thought to herself. <em>Didn’t the lights…</em></p> <p>She lost her balance, disrupting the thought as she fell down. She tried to lean on the wall beside her for support, but found that instead, her hand had somehow… phased through the nasty wall entirely. She gasped as she realized what had just happened, halting her crying immediately as all the noise in the room defaulted to the overwhelming buzzing once more. She tried to pull her hand out of the wall in a panicked rush, growing more distressed by the second. She began to hyperventilate as her senses began to get overwhelmed; Her ears began getting overpowered by the roaring hum-buzz of the lights, her eyes began to get blurry as the room spun in circles, her nose got tingly from a sudden horrible smell, her tongue felt numb by the taste of the same odor, and her hand was stuck inside of a wall. The walls of the room began to close in on her as the room grew smaller and smaller, and the buzzing grew louder and louder, almost deafening her.</p> <p>As the walls closed in on her fully, her last thought was of Max, and how she may have just found out what had happened to him… She closed her eyes, bracing herself for whatever lied beyond the wall.</p> <hr /> <p>Macy heard nothing but the overpowering buzzing of the lights she had been in the presence of for so long. She looked around her, observing nothing but a dark void in every single area around her. Flashes of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/blue-channel">blue</a> began to spark like bolts of lightning around her. She felt a sickening feeling of reminiscence coursing through her body, as if she remembered this place but couldn't put her finger on it. She was unsure what was happening to her: Had she died? Had she arrived into the great beyond? Was this what awaited her after death?</p> <p>These thoughts were interrupted as she suddenly found herself on an ancient carpet, which looked like it was several decades past its last cleaning. She got up, groaning in disgust as she felt the moisture of the carpet on her skin. She blinked a few times as she got used to the new environment around her, still slightly disoriented from her previous experience. She could make out a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">large, empty office room</a>, which had mono-yellow wallpaper plastered all over it. There were also perfectly symmetrical rows of those same obnoxious fluorescent lights on the ceiling, which were not dissimilar to the ones from the basement. Disgusting, tacky, ugly; in combo with the equally nasty carpet and those dang lights, it did not help the room's first impression on her.</p> <p>&quot;What the&#8230;&quot; she whispered to herself, squinting at the sudden change in lighting. She began to chuckle slightly in relief. She wasn't dead after all; it was just some secret room in the basement which she had found herself in. She stood up and turned around the corner, half-expecting Max to be there waiting for her with the missing man right next to him.</p> <p>Her optimism faded instantly when she found that the room did not end as she made her way around the corner, rather, the room simply led into another identical one. The wet carpet, tacky walls, noisy lights: It was entirely the same, save for the layout itself. She rushed to the other end of the room, panicked at what other discoveries she would make. To her horror, she found out that even this wasn't the only duplicate room, no, several rooms awaited her through what now made itself clear to be a maze, each one the same as the last.</p> <p>&quot;Where&#8230; am I?&quot; she muttered, suddenly feeling the gravity of her situation hit her. &quot;Hello?&quot; she said a bit more loudly than before, hearing her voice reverberate around the halls.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-12">Howling</a>, coming from a few rooms down. Her eyes widened in shock, as the realization that she was probably not alone dawned on her. She bolted away from the howling, running through room after room as she tried to search for an exit from the increasingly terrifying place. The moist carpet squelched beneath her feet with every rushed step that she took, barely audible over the hum-buzz of the fluorescent lights. Eventually, she could run no more, so she decided to lay down on the ground as she huffed and panted. Her senses were entirely overloaded: Her eyes could not handle the light, her ears could not handle the buzzing, her nose could not handle the rancid smell&#8230;</p> <p>She truly couldn't rest in this place as it seemed.</p> <p>She pulled out her phone, checking if she had any form of a signal which she could use to call for help. Her reception was completely blank, not much to her surp-</p> <p>A notification popped up at the top of her screen, alerting her that there was an open <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-21">Wi-Fi</a> network which she could connect to. Astonished, she tapped on it, and was taken to the Wi-Fi settings option where she could connect to the signal in question. The name of the Wi-Fi was completely random; a mess of letters and numbers jumbled up together with no form or semblance of any word she knew. She tapped on it, hands quivering, and was relieved to find that there was no password which she had to input to connect with it.</p> <p>Now that she had a stable connection, she immediately began to work away at establishing where she was. She opened google maps to find that, much to her confusion, she was located several miles away from good old Florida; right in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. She didn't even have the time to act confused about it either, as the Wi-Fi signal cut out shortly after she made this revelation, rendering the app unusable.</p> <p>&quot;Seriously?&quot; she mumbled to herself. &quot;What the heck is going on with this signal&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>She checked for it once more, and found that it was entirely gone. She turned the phone on and off again, and found it back at four bars not long after. Mere seconds later, it fluctuated down to two bars, jumping from bar to bar faster than a ping pong ball in the middle of a heated game of table tennis.</p> <p>She decided it was better than nothing, and used the opportunity to call for help. She opened her contacts list, pressing Aaron’s name. She put the phone to her ear as the call attempted to connect, waiting to hear the ring. She perked up in excitement after hearing a noise from the other end.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, but unfortunately your call could not be completed at this time. If this problem persists, please call your service provider at-”</p> <p>She sighed ended the call, knowing that attempting to call anyone was useless without a stable signal. She gave up on the infuriatingly fickle Wi-Fi, putting her phone back in her pocket. She’d never seen her internet connection fluctuate that quickly, but it wasn't the strangest thing she'd encountered so far.</p> <p>She decided to just further explore the new environment she was in for now, attempting to figure out <em>where</em> exactly she actually was. She walked through the rooms for hours on end, documenting all of her findings on her phone's notes app, whilst also trying to maintain her phone's battery as best as she could. It was not long before she began to consider giving up, as the repetitiveness of the rooms had begun to get to her, when suddenly she found a room that was different from the ones she'd come across before.</p> <p>The room had the same washed decor as the other rooms, save for the fact that on one side of the room, a regular-looking door stood proudly amidst the endless sea of mono-yellow. Normally, she wouldn't give it much attention; it was a regular door, why would she? Except, this regular door was something truly extraordinary in the circumstances she found herself in. She put her ear to the door, hearing nothing but ominous silence on the other side. Was it just a new gateway to another set of rooms?</p> <p>She decided to open it nonetheless, a final bout of hesitation hitting her just before she turned the knob. <em>What if it's not just rooms beyond this door? What if there's&#8230; worse places to be trapped in than here?</em></p> <p>Eventually however, curiosity killed the cat. If she was going to die, so be it; she was tired of the monotonous rooms anyways. She turned the knob, slowly opening the door and poking her head in, surprised to find that there was a&#8230; comfortable looking lounge inside of it? Was she hallucinating?</p> <p>The walls were painted a startling shade of titanium white, and several pieces of blue furniture was strewn about the room: Couches, tables; even a blue TV. The carpets were a shade of dark grey, which was a vast improvement over the carpets in the other rooms. There were also pictures, canvases, and murals hung on the walls of the lounge, all depicting a blue parrot. The room itself was also something to behold: it was gargantuan, with several other corridors and doors present in it, which she supposed lead to other rooms. Odd was the only word she could use to describe the place.</p> <p>She walked in silently, closing the door behind her and creating a small echo in the room. She cautiously made her way around the room, exploring several areas of it in search of possible supplies. Her eyes widened as she saw a mini-fridge in one part of the room, and she quickly ran to it as silently as she could, throwing open the door in ravenous hunger. Her stomach did double-flips as she saw that it was filled to the brim with delicacies and supplies, and her mouth began to water at the sight of her favourite food: Cheese.</p> <p>She took out the plate of cheese and began to devour it like a rabid dog, not even allowing the food to touch her taste buds as she satisfied all of her hunger. After she was done with the cheese, she turned once more to the fridge in search of something to drink. Her eyes moved towards a set of thermoses at the end of the fridge, which she opened to find that they were filled with water. She put her lips onto the brim of the thermos, taking in its odd vanilla scent, and brought it up, guzzling the precious liquid into he-</p> <p>&quot;BLEUGH, what on Earth?!&quot; she said as she spat out the water, an utterly disgusted look plastered on her face. She gagged at the taste, which was reminiscent of almonds. She hated almonds, but despite that fact, she still felt satisfied with the drink, fulfilled by it. She logged this observation along with the entire lounge area with the rest of her notes.</p> <p>Mid-way through logging said notes, she heard the doorknob of the door jiggle from the other side of it. She dived behind one of the couches in one swift motion, hiding from whoever — or whatever — was coming from the other side. She watched as the door opened, and a crowd of people clad in blue robes made their way into the lounge.</p> <p>&quot;Imma telling you, I walk back in here to get a snack, and like, boom, nothin's left of the wall, s'all just a big black void,&quot; a female voice ranted in anger.</p> <p>Macy watched as a woman, who wore loose grey leggings and a grey jacket, walked into the room. Her hair was extremely long and greasy, and her skin looked particularly oily and disgusting. She had hazel eyes with freckles all over her face. It was obvious she didn’t take much pride in her appearance or sanitation. A black, inky substance was leaking from her mouth, dripping onto the floor in giant dollops, staining the gray carpet. The sight of this caused Macy to feel a bit sick to her stomach. She seemed to be the only one of the bunch that wasn't wearing a blue robe.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair, this better not be one of your manic overreactions,&quot; a parrot-like voice &#8212; no, a <em>bird</em> cawed? Macy stared in shock as a bird like the one depicted in the paintings flew into the room alongside the woman. It perched on the woman's &#8212; who she presumed was Sinclair &#8212; shoulder, as the last members of the group made their way into the room, shutting the door behind them.</p> <p>&quot;It isn't, I <em>promise</em>. Check it out, it's right over there, see?&quot; she replied, pointing towards the end of one of the hallways.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair, it's probably just a wall some moron painted black. That ink you insist on drinking is probably just getting to your head,&quot; a strange man said. His voice sounded fragile, feeble, old, pretty similar to what she imagined a mummy would sound like. Macy tried to get a better look at his face, but she couldn't make out any of its details. Instead, she focused on the more esoteric features of the man; mainly his downright bizarre clothes.</p> <p>Just like the rest of his companions, he wore a blue cloak, but unlike them, he wore a goofy mask that was similar to the beak of the parrot she had seen earlier. Its beak opened and closed with each movement of his mouth. He also had a comically large blade strapped onto his back, which was blue like the rest of his clothing, and it looked <em>extremely</em> sharp, which she found concerning. He wore feather-covered gloves, the only parts of his body which she could actually see due to the cloak which he wore. As he took steps across the room, she saw flashes of his feet, which looked like&#8230;</p> <p>&quot;Bird&#8230; talons?&quot;</p> <p>She snickered at the man's ridiculous costume, but immediately clasped her mouth as she realised the mistake she'd just made. <em>A fatal mistake</em>, she thought to herself as the man stopped dead in his tracks.</p> <p>&quot;Everyone, halt.&quot; He glared at the crowd to convey his seriousness. The chatter amongst the group stopped immediately, all eyes turning towards the man.</p> <p>&quot;What is it, Father Bluebird?&quot; the blue parrot squawked in reply. The man remained silent for a moment, holding his index finger up.</p> <p>&quot;We are not alone in the lounge. There is a foreign presence with us here,&quot; he replied. Tension filled the room as he uttered the last of these words, as silence overcame all of those in the group. Macy slowed her breathing to further her chances of staying hidden, which was an ironic contrast to her heart, which was beating with the same ferocity of a hummingbird's wings.</p> <p>For a while, she thought that she had outsmarted them, and that she had actually not been caught whatsoever. However, no news is certainly not always good news; just a few seconds after the thought had passed through her head, she saw the masked man's head appear over the couch, peering down at her with contempt as she panicked anew.</p> <p>&quot;Wait, please! I can ex-&quot; Macy stammered before being cut off by him.</p> <p>&quot;I knew it! Someone was here all along!&quot; the old man interrupted, suddenly bursting into maniacal laughter which escaped through his wrinkled lips. His expression turned sour as quickly as he had burst into laughter, and he hastily pulled her up opposite to him. His face was entirely covered by the mask at the bottom, but nothing covered the cold, dark eyes that pierced through the fibre of her being, sending shivers down her spine. He reached for his blade, drawing it from his back with unnatural, inhuman swiftness; truly, a sight to behold.</p> <p>The four foot long blade, now unrestrained by the narrow case which held it, glinted under the dazzling lights of the room. The coloration of it was shockingly blue, and it was encrusted with several intricately crafted gold markings, which lined the edges of the blade's finely forged metal.</p> <p>Father Bluebird lunged towards her, putting the forte of the blade right up to her neck, effectively trapping her where she stood. Macy tried to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth to do so, he put the sword closer to her neck as if to tell her to stop speaking if she valued her life.</p> <p>&quot;Jerry,&quot; he said as he looked at the bird, venom lacing his voice. &quot;Do I have your permission to kill this intruder?&quot;</p> <p>No. She was <em>not</em> going to let it all end like this. She kicked him in the calf, causing the old man to lose his balance and collapse, dropping the blade from his grasp. Macy, now loose from the trap, punched the man in his gut. Contrary to what she thought would happen, he sprang up from the ground, lunging at her anew. She attempted to punch him once more, but he was prepared this time, catching her first with his feathery hand in midair. Macy tried to use her other hand to knock him out, but it was futile, as it underwent the same fate as her other hand.</p> <p>He pushed Macy until her back was plastered to a wall, ramming her with his head in the process like a bull would've. He then flipped her over his head, and slammed her onto the carpeted ground, knocking the wind straight out of her and leaving her gasping for air. He swooped to the ground to grab his blade once more, and held the pointy tip to her neck.</p> <p>&quot;How- how did yo-&quot; gasped Macy in shock, barely able to utter the words.</p> <p>&quot;I will ask once more, hopefully for the last time: do I have the permission to end this pathetic worm's life?&quot; the old man snarled through clenched teeth, this time not taking his eyes off of Macy. The bird flew off of Sinclair's shoulder, perching on Macy's chest and maintaining eye contact with her.</p> <p>&quot;What is your name, young one?&quot; the bird cawed quietly, its voice sounding all too similar to what a stereotypical pirate parrot would’ve. The man moved his blade away as the bird sat on the chest, retracting it meekly as if scared that he had hurt &#8212; or offended &#8212; the bird in some way.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, can I ask just one teensy tiny question: What in the ever-loving heck is going on here?!&quot; yelled Macy, ignoring the question. She flicked the bird off of her chest, causing it to lose its balance and be pushed back. The cloaked people began muttering in shock and disapproval. Some showed immediate hostility to her in the form of jeers and boos as she stood up from her position on the ground, backing away from the armed man.</p> <p>&quot;How dare you!&quot; screamed Father Bluebird in a fervent display of loyalty to the bird.</p> <p>&quot;No! None of this nonsense! I have questions I want answered, and you better be able to answer them!&quot; Macy threatened, revealing her taser and aiming it at the old man. The crowd of people gasped at her boldness, the murmurs getting louder.</p> <p>&quot;What is this blasphemy?&quot; the old man growled.</p> <p>&quot;I wake up in an utterly disgusting room, and then I get out of it to see there's more of it, and even more the further I explored. Did one of you maniacs actually go through the trouble of filling each one of them with those sickening walls, or those revolting carpets, or- or- or those STUPID BLOODY LIGHTS!&quot;</p> <p>Her screaming silenced all the murmurs that had been circulating amongst the group. &quot;I walk around for hours and hours on end, to end up here with you weirdos. She's got ink gushing out of her mouth like a waterfall, this guy's waving a giant sword at me and threatening to kill me, and I don't even want to get started on your obsession with this <em>talking bird</em>, who, seems to be the most normal out of you all!&quot; she breathed in deeply, and exhaled it out slowly, calming herself down. &quot;What in Pete’s sake is going on here? And where's Max?&quot;</p> <p>No answers. This only made her more frustrated, but she kept it inside this time.</p> <p>&quot;I'll ask you once more, hopefully for the last time. What is your name?&quot; the bird cawed calmly.</p> <p>&quot;Macy.&quot; she replied, breathing heavily from her outburst. The bird flapped its wings, flying into the air and landing on a nearby bird perch.</p> <p>&quot;So you're new to The Backrooms, huh?&quot; it squawked.</p> <p>&quot;What on earth are you talking about?&quot; Macy asked through clenched teeth, still holding her taser at the armed man.</p> <p>&quot;Congratulations then, you've made it outside of reality itself. I'm Jerry, or as some refer to me, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7">Entity 7</a>. Although, I do prefer the former, so I'd rather you not refer to me as Entity 7.&quot; Jerry replied, bowing its little body as it spoke. Macy blinked a few times in confusion.</p> <p>&quot;Hold on, there's- there's <em>seven</em>?!&quot; she exclaimed in surprise.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, yes, the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">Meggies</a> refer to those of us which are native to this realm as 'entities', and they've logged hundreds of us in their silly database. I've always abhorred how they group me in with the rest of the creatures here, as if I'm anything like them! Bah, regardless of that, all you need to know for now is that you've escaped the bounds of reality, and you've now entered what are known as The Backrooms. Not many people are on my good side, but I like you.&quot; Jerry cooed, a mischievous grin on its face.</p> <p>&quot;I&#8230; need a minute. To process all this- this&#8230; you know&#8230;&quot; Macy said, lowering her taser and throwing her hands around the room. She fell backward onto one of the sofas, a look of shock and confusion all over her face.</p> <p>&quot;Oookayyy, now that we're done with that little production, can I request that you all just, follow me around so I can show you what I was talking about?&quot; yelled Sinclair, ink still dripping from her mouth.</p> <p>&quot;Fine Sinclair. You may lead the way.&quot; Jerry squawked, turning to Macy.</p> <p>&quot;Why don't you come with us?&quot; it said, jumping onto her shoulders and bobbing its head forward, beckoning her to move forward with the rest of the group without giving her a chance to refuse or accept its offer. She tensed a little, still shook by her experience, but obeyed anyways as she walked after the crowd of people which was lead by Sinclair. Father Bluebird occasionally glared at her throughout the whole procession, which solidified her feeling that she'd already made an enemy in this place.</p> <p>They walked down the corridors, turning through several hallways of rooms which the people probably lived in. They reached the end of the hallway which Sinclair wanted to show them, where one of the white walls was painted an eigengrau shade of grey. Sinclair smirked as the group looked in confusion at the sight before them, still confused as to why Sinclair was making such a fuss about it.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair, you idiot,&quot; Father Bluebird grumbled. He walked through the crowd, purposefully bumping Macy with his shoulder on his path towards the front of the group. &quot;You've been here for how long now? And you still have no clue how this place works?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Sinclair asked, slightly angry at his sarcasm. &quot;Don't give me that sass you bag of dust; I know how this place works as much as you do.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Do I need to spell it out to you?!&quot; the old man replied at this, raising his voice. &quot;You see, in The Backrooms, you can go through walls sometimes. Walls go dark sometimes, meaning you can clip through them. Is that not truly wonderful?&quot; he said in a condescending tone, making several gestures with his hand to exaggerate his point.</p> <p>&quot;No! They don't just up and decide one day that they're gonna turn into the void, clippable walls look different than this!&quot; Sinclair stammered.</p> <p>Father Bluebird rolled his eyes. &quot;Watch.&quot; he grumbled.</p> <p>He approached the darkness, and proceeded to stick his feathery hand into it, looking back at Sinclair with a smug look barely inferable on his covered face.</p> <p>&quot;B-but&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair, my hand has just clipped through the wall. You see? This isn't anyth-&quot; Father Bluebird stopped his sarcastic comments as he pulled his arm out of the wall, only to find that it was gone; cut right off where his hand had not entered the void. The tip of his arm was gone now, replaced by a flat, clean cut, which showed his bones and muscles in full display. He screamed as blood began to spray out of the now exposed wound on his arm like a fountain, drenching the members and staining the walls with the spurts of crimson liquid. The group was lit ablaze with distress.</p> <p>&quot;Oh my gosh, we need to help him!&quot; Macy cried, her police instincts instantly kicking in. She threw her vest and top off, which left her in nothing but her sleeveless undershirt. She quickly grabbed the man's bleeding arm and tied her shirt around it, tightening it as much as she physically could. The blue shirt was immediately covered in scarlet red stains, which combined with the color of the shirt to turn it a deep shade of purple. She squeezed his forearm with her left hand to apply further pressure, holding the shirt tight with the right.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Father Bluebird yelled through pained screams. He tried to escape her grasp, fighting against her grip.</p> <p>&quot;Helping you, moron! Quit struggling!&quot; Macy exclaimed in distress. &quot;Is there like, a hospital or something in this place?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; cried Jerry. &quot;The only medical assistance you can get here is from the Meggies. Hurry up now, stop the bleeding!&quot;</p> <p>“Why can’t we just ask them, then?” Macy replied in confusion.</p> <p>“Well, my dear, we aren’t on very good terms with them. I predict Father Bluebird’s very presence among them would cause them to all run in fear, if not attempt to detain him.” Jerry sighed, looking slightly concerned at what this meant for his most devoted follower’s future.</p> <p>&quot;Darn it!&quot; Macy sighed, frustrated by the revelation. She put Father Bluebird on one of the nearby couches, squeezing his arm to apply the pressure needed to aid in the halting of the bleeding.</p> <p>&quot;So, like, what is this thing?&quot; Sinclair asked, looking at the void. She reached into her jacket pocket, and pulled out a small flashlight. She shined it at the void, but the patch was not illuminated, retaining its dark form despite the fact that light was being shined directly onto it. Sinclair, still seemingly confused by this, grabbed a pillow from a nearby couch and threw it at the void. It was immediately swallowed up, with no sign of returning any time soon. She stood there, as if expecting something else to happen, but just like Father Bluebird's hand, it was gone. This confused her greatly.</p> <p>She turned back to face Macy and Father Bluebird, who was currently writhing on the couch in agony. The bleeding had slowed down, but the pain was still extreme, and he had lost his color, turning a ghostly shade of white.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair,&quot; The bird commanded. &quot;Watch over Father Bluebird. I need to speak with Macy.&quot; Jerry cawed. Sinclair immediately followed the order, sitting down onto the couch next to the old man, comforting him and applying pressure like Macy had been doing earlier. In the meantime, Macy followed an airborne Jerry back into the main room, who stood on a closed box in a corner when they arrived there.</p> <p>&quot;There is something about you which I find most endearing.&quot; Jerry said, intrigue in its voice as it flashed her a cunning glance. Macy itched her bare shoulder, looking at Jerry as if being a talking parrot wasn't the craziest thing it’d done today.</p> <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Macy asked.</p> <p>&quot;There's a reason I have not put you under my control yet,&quot; Jerry cawed. &quot;The reason they all follow me with such vehement dedication is not due to their own vocation, but rather&#8230; one of my powers. I can persuade people into doing what I want, manipulate them into becoming but pawns on my chessboard, and if someone gets close to me&#8230; let's just say that they'll be a part of my group for a long, long, time: Permanently, and irreversibly.&quot;</p> <p>Macy gulped as soon as Jerry finished its monologue. She felt less and less safe around the bird as the minutes went by. Jerry seemed to notice her fear, and it was relishing every ounce of it.</p> <p>&quot;Do not look so scared; the power is not necessarily constant among all my followers &#8212; I have spared you from it after all. In all actuality&#8230; I have an offer for you, my child.&quot; Jerry squeezed its talons on the handle of the box, and flew into the air, opening it. Macy craned her neck forward to see what was inside, and found in it a beautiful golden robe, not dissimilar to the other members' robes in make, but all the much different in the aura which it gave off. Macy looked up at Jerry, who now flapped onto its perch next to her ear.</p> <p>&quot;There is a prophecy; one that foretells that a newcomer to The Backrooms shall become my right hand upon arriving to me and making their first impressions on me. The criteria which you fit is beyond you &#8212; I cannot begin to explain my thought process in the first place &#8212; but, you will do great with me, we shall bring an end to pain and suffering in The Backrooms, and perhaps some day, find an exit, bring salvation to the people here. Perhaps you will consider my methods inhumane at first, but you will understand in due time that my ideals are for the greater good.&quot;</p> <p>The bird stared at Macy, who was now even more confused than she was before. &quot;But&#8230; why me? I know that you said that your criteria is a secret, but why did you not choose someone like Father Bluebird instead of me?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh no, trust me; I have considered Father Bluebird before, they are my most dedicated follower by far. However, Father Bluebird is simply not the right one. There is something about you in particular which drives me to believe that you are the correct choice. I have no reason to support this belief other than my own instincts, but&#8230; I think I have finally made my choice, after all these centuries of waiting for you, dear chosen one, to come to me.</p> <p>&quot;Wait, are you saying&#8230;&quot; Macy muttered, perplexed by Jerry's monologue.</p> <p>&quot;Yes dear, you are now the Chosen One, the new highest member of the group.&quot; Jerry smiled, its black beak rising to its cheeks. Macy's breath began to get shaky as she stared at the bird, any shred of belief that the bird was not a megalomaniac shattering right in front of her.</p> <p>&quot;But&#8230; what if I refuse? What if I don't want to be a part of this?&quot;</p> <p>Jerry turned its head sideways, looking at her intently as its expression turned sour. &quot;The option for me to make you just like them is still on the table, you know?&quot;</p> <p>Macy remembered what it had told her it could do just a few minutes ago. She did not want to be made a puppet of, but she also did not want to have to be a part of the bird's followers. She considered turning around and running straight to the exit, but she had no idea how far Jerry's powers could reach. Further pondering brought her to the conclusion that even if she did escape, she'd just end up back where she started, in the endless labyrinth of yellow rooms which she'd escaped from out of sheer luck. Who knows how long it would take her to find someone else, if ever?</p> <p>She concluded that it would be best to stay with Jerry. Maniacal and utterly despicable, but also safe and secure. Macy bent down and reached into the box, unfolding the cloak and watching it shimmer in the light as if it was actually made of gold. White markings lined it along the sleeves, edges, and seams. It was beautiful.</p> <p>&quot;Go ahead, try it on.&quot; Jerry squawked. Macy raised the bottom of the cloak over her head, and slipped it down her body. She reached her arms into the sleeves, adjusted it over her body, and looked towards Jerry for a form of approval. It fit her perfectly, as if it was specifically tailored just for her. Maybe the bird was actually right.</p> <p>&quot;Wow, this is&#8230; glamorous. It's wonderful!&quot; Macy smiled half-heartedly. She couldn't deny that the cloak looked amazing, it was just that&#8230; the circumstances leading up to her getting it were <em>worrying</em>, to say the least.</p> <p>&quot;Welcome to your new family, Chosen One. Welcome to the Followers of Jerry!&quot;</p> <p>Macy smiled at it, this time a bit wider in hopes of appearing more genuine. She had already begun to doubt if this was the right course of action for her to have taken.</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="font: 1.5rem 'Mate SC'"> <p><strong>Weeks later&#8230;</strong></p> </div> </div> <p>A few weeks had passed since Macy was inaugurated as the Chosen One. At the present moment, she lay on her bed in her specially made room, utterly exhausted due to the hectic weeks that had just passed. Being the co-leader of an otherworldly cult, just as she had presumed, was as chaotic as a cult could possibly get.</p> <p>Just yesterday, Sinclair had stormed out of the room, ranting about some conspiracy related to the &quot;Meggies&quot; which she had yet to meet, claiming that the void that she had now obsessed with was their doing. She had even made a stereotypical conspiracy board in her room, which Macy found both concerning and absurd. Macy didn't fret however. She had been told multiple times that Sinclair was prone to doing these things, and that she would be back in due time. What was up with that nutjob anyways?</p> <p>Her rest was cut short when she suddenly heard commotion in the lounge. She woke up and pressed her ears to the door, waiting in suspense for what was to happen.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair! Why are you bringing lost ones into our chuch?&quot; a voice exclaimed from the lobby. Macy recognized it as the voice of one of her fellow followers, Kira. She quickly retracted from the door and went to her wardrobe, in which she had her only robe hanging, miraculously having stayed clean despite its weeks without a proper washing. She put it on quickly, not caring if she looked tidy or not, and lifted her hood up as she exited the room to see what exactly all the commotion was about.</p> <p>She was beginning to feel a tiny tinge of recognition from the voice that was now speaking in the lounge, the origin of it coming very close to her fingertips before her train of thought was interrupted by a grumpy looking Father Bluebird, who was coming from the other side of the hallway.</p> <p>&quot;Quite rude of them to come in and make such a racket, what is going on in there?&quot; he said to her.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not entirely sure, it's probably just one of Sinclair's antic-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yo, Macy!&quot; she heard Sinclair yell from the main room, interrupting her sentence mid-way through. &quot;You got someone who wants to see you!&quot;</p> <p>From nowhere in particular, Jerry flew onto Macy's shoulder, encouraging her to continue forward. She obeyed its commands, walking into the main room with Jerry on her right shoulder as her flowery robe glittered in the rays of light cast by the lounge's overhead lights. Father Bluebird followed close behind, emerging into the room mere seconds after she did. They all looked at Sinclair, as she and the other followers bowed in Jerry's presence. The trio truly made a scene of the place.</p> <p>&quot;Who did you bring this time, Sinclair?&quot; Jerry squawked from atop her shoulder. Macy looked up at the people it was referring to; a group of people all clad in black polo shirts with an eagle crest on it. One of them was a tall, scrawny-looking man with glasses who's hair was blonde and curly, beautiful in its own way despite the fact it was messy and unkempt. Her eyes widened as she began to recognize the man that stood before her, tuning out all others in the room.</p> <p><em>Could it actually be him?</em> she thought to herself.</p> <p>&quot;Meggies&#8230;&quot; Father Bluebird grumbled as Macy continued to stare at the man before her agape. He seemed to be just as surprised as her, which meant only one thing.</p> <p>She lowered her hood to get a better look at him, confirming to him that his suspicions had been true. For a while, everything was silent, before the man whispered one shaky word, barely able to keep his surprise intact.</p> <p>&quot;Macy?&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;Max&#8230;&quot;</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="font: 1.5rem 'Mate SC'"> <p><strong>The Broken City will continue in Chapter 3</strong></p> </div> </div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Jerry&nbsp;lore&nbsp;o_0</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="styled-quote"> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Author</strong></span></p> <p>Written by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713002" alt="Natedagreat563" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563" >Natedagreat563</a></span><br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/natedagreatap">Author Page</a><br /> Characters of Jerry, Father Bluebird, and Sinclair Beckett by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/1000dumplings" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=2864629&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713002" alt="1000dumplings" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=2864629)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/1000dumplings" >1000dumplings</a></span>, used with permission<br /> Decay canon by <span class="error-inline"><em>ArgonMighty</em> does not match any existing user name</span></p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <th colspan="2">Other Pages By This Author</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Levels</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3">Electrical Station</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/th3-sh4dy-gr3y">TH3 SH4DY GR3Y</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-903">The Metro</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-904">The Dark Metro</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Sub-Sections</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5-1">Terror Hotel Casino</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-800-1">Level 800.1</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Entities</th> <td><a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-195">Endless/Nameless</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-600">The Saberzoa</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/icarus-procidens">Icarus Procidens</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Objects</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-56">The Ultimate Backrooms Cookbook</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-36">Spirit Links</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1">Almond Water</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Tales</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/archived-journals-of-lucy-fox">Archived Journals of Lucy Fox</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/city-boy">The Broken City Part 1: City Boy</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/macy">The Broken City Part 2: Macy</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/meggies">The Broken City Part 3: Meggies</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/terror">The Broken City Part 4: Terror</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/good-intentions">The Broken City Part 5: Good Intentions</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/blanches-halloween-party">Blanche’s Halloween Party</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/ascension">Ascension</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/cracks">Cracks</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>People of Interest</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/eden-g">Eden G.</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Guides/Essays</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/sd-class-guide">Survival Difficulty Class System Guide</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/offset-guide">Offsets 101</a></td> </tr> </table> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Licensing</strong></span></p> <p>“Macy” by Natedagreat563 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is elementary to simply state that you appreciate your life. All one has to is open their mouth, and say that they do so out loud, without much thought given to that phrase. Most will have been asked this question at minimum once in their lifetime, and they will most probably have answered with affirmation, but without true meaning given to what they have said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is that exact same presumptuousness that leads us to equate life&#039;s value with the obsolete, focusing but on our materialistic naughts and not on the true connotations of the life we have been given one chance to fully experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How well do you truly appreciate sentience? Thought?&lt;/em&gt; Living &lt;em&gt;as a whole? Can you truly say you appreciate your life without having your esse be jeopardized at some point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertain this thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your existence has been limited to one year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One year from now, starting right as you read this message, your whole world will be erased. Everything you have strived to achieve, all the bonds you&#039;ve forged and broken, the sublime memories that play around in your mind, all cast away in an instant, one year from now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you do with your remaining time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would you try and fight destiny? Would you hope for a chance that the cards that were dealt to you are simply faux? Would you keep the one gift Pandora&#039;s box has hitherto given to humanity close to your heart?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would you surrender to despair? Content with allowing yourself to fade into oblivion? Satisfied to watch the curtains close, without putting up, at the bare minimum, a final, pathetic struggle for the crowd that watches in the stand?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertain this thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think long and hard before answering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The abyss has all the time in the world to hear your answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After all, it listens, but its elective does not change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-0&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Decay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decay Canon follows the experience of several inhabitants of The Backrooms as their home for god knows how long begins to wither and die in front of them. A mysterious patch of darkness begins to spread around The Backrooms, taking all the nostalgic hellscapes and the entities that live in them with it. Different groups begin making unlikely allies in hopes of stopping the eventual death of The Backrooms, and the prioritization of finding an exit is emphasized the closer the backrooms gets to mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main premise of the Decay Canon is hope and despair, and how the inhabitants go about facing an unknown evil that is greater than anything else they could&#039;ve ever imagined. Strengths are found in common goals, and temporary peace is brought upon The Backrooms if only for a few precious moments. But in the end, is that enough to stop The Decay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canon is split into 4 parts, each detailing the progression of the spread and how it changes the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the end. More and more reports come to the M.E.G&#039;s attention about a strange patch of void that seems to grow bigger with each passing moment. Struggling to verify these claims, the M.E.G does not give much care to it at first, but the blissful ignorance only lasts a small amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different explorer groups around The Backrooms begin reporting the same thing. More and more people start seeing the elusive patches of darkness, and eventually, they all come to the same conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something terribly evil has just begun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the several different groups have noticed the spread, it is undeniable that something must be done about it. As the different groups of The Backrooms try to maintain relative normalcy as best as they can, they start researching several different methods of escaping The Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several different explorations are made to the exit, as traversing the backrooms becomes harder and harder. The connections between levels begin to be severed, trapping the inhabitants inside. Transportation around the backrooms becomes a glaring issue as people begin to prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in the backrooms as it was known has changed drastically. The different groups of The Backrooms have formed uneasy and desperate alliances with each other, and what once were the greatest of enemies have now banded together against the spread as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scramble for an exit grows all the more desperate, as entire levels have begun being consumed by The Decay. Entities of The Backrooms watch in dismay as their homes are destroyed, and the last secure vestiges of humanity are breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end times have grown near…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it. Singularity looms above The Backrooms with every passing day. Levels have almost all deteriorated completely, yet some beings still persist for some hope of survival. The last few humans watch cold and alone, knowing their days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despair has taken over, nothingness reigns supreme, and the once glorious Backrooms are on their last knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-1&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-tale entries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-tale entries fall into 2 categories, 1) Normal entries affected by the events of Decay, or 2) Entries that exist solely because of Decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the former, write the article like you normally would, and find a way to link it to Decay. If an object before used to emit a light that melted people&#039;s hands off, then in the context of Decay it could perhaps also thwart the Decay in some form among other things. If an entity used to hate the M.E.G. for some reason, it could instead choose to ally itself with the opposing group for it&#039;s own purposes related to the Decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latter, your article has to propose a different twist to the normal formula. What does this thing have to do with the Decay? Why does it fit into the canon, as in, what relations does it have to the story/characters? For example, you could write something like a material that was specifically created to thwart the Decay, or perhaps a Level that is the base of operations for a group of people who try to fight the Decay. There&#039;s lots of possibilities with this, and it&#039;s up to you to write them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s an open canon after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-off tales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, before writing anything for the canon, consider this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what phase of the canon does your work fall into?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&#039;ve answered that, plan your writing accordingly. What will your characters do that has to do with the Decay? What&#039;s the setting, and how is it affected by the Decay? What&#039;s the resolution of this tale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have to make sure that your tale does not contradict anything in the main series. That is the most important series of Decay, and tampering with the main series would fuck with the whole premise of Decay, since that series is the backbone of Decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep all of these in mind, and once that is all planned out, you can begin writing. It&#039;s that simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tale series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a tad bit more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing a series, you don&#039;t have just one tale to keep track of, you have a whole system of characters and scenarios, and that can be a bit of an issue. You have to watch out for main series contradictions as mentioned earlier, albeit on a grander scale now. You also have to manage your characters over all the phases, as well as the scenes of the phases themselves. There&#039;s also the fact that you need to have a plot for it all as well. You can&#039;t just copy main series in the plot, so you have to be creative here as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fun thing about series however: Since the canon is in it&#039;s early stages, series separate from the main series will be able to interact with the main series in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan on writing a series, then it is practically a necessity to contact me (SariaStuff) for details on planning it out. Reach out to me on discord or dms, and I will gladly explain how you can do it whilst also co-existing with the main series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon Crossing and Decay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is totally fine to canon cross other canons and Decay. The only foreseeable issue that this may have is in the context of the other canon, and not Decay: Decay does not make sense from the perspective of other canons, especially considering the rules by which this canon plays by, not to mention the very premise of this canon which may be strange for the canon you are writing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, if you still wish to go with it, make sure that it makes sense in the context of &lt;strong&gt;Decay&lt;/strong&gt;, since the main attraction in Decay writing is Decay itself, so writing for other canons would mean that Decay has to take the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should any further questions be needed about this matter, I urge you to contact me so we can clear them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-4&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Decay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At face value, the Decay is a patch of darkness that spreads itself around The Backrooms, consuming everything it can spread on. It is both something and not: As in, it is the lack of matter, the lack of substance, but it is not entirely the &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; lack of anything, it is still something, not entirely nothing (If that makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what the Decay &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is, that&#039;s up to you to decide. No origin stories can or will be written for the origin of the Decay, so it&#039;s left up to interpretation. Want it to be created by general expansion of The Backrooms in the same vein as the heat death of the universe? Sure. Want it to be the product of some guy playing Nickelback really loudly which causes the world to rupture? Sure, like, why would you think that in the first place, but sure. It&#039;s basically left up for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to decide what made this thing. That&#039;s what&#039;s so fun about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the spreading work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit strange, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll start of with the basic stuff, like spreading in general, speed of the spread, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decay spreads pretty slowly around The Backrooms on average. Whilst in some cases it can move a bit faster than its normal speed (i.e about a snail&#039;s pace max), most times will move at really slow speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decay spreads around The Backrooms by unknown means. As said earlier, it all relies on your headcanon, so it can be anything you want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it spread onto living things? Yes, and no. I will not be elaborating further for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the most complicated part of this: How does it spread through the different states of matter? Here are my thoughts on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In solids, the Decay spreads as mentioned earlier: Very slowly. It moves on the surfaces of the things it spreads onto, covering them, and essentially making them objects covered by portals to the void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In liquids, the Decay does not spread whatsoever, with exceptions being only those liquids that do not touch anything else (Think a floating patch of water in space, that&#039;s the kinda stuff I&#039;m talking about).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In gases, the Decay spreads only when a sizeable chunk of the surrounding area has been decayed, e.g, it won&#039;t begin to spread to the gases in a room until half of the room has been decayed. And even then, it still spreads as slow it does on solids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one is unique. The decay spreads the fastest in vacuums. Think about it: There is nothing in a vacuum, and the Decay is pretty much as close to nothing as you can get! Decay spreads instantly throughout vacuums, so good luck surviving in a place that&#039;s surrounded by them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens to irregular matter? No clue, it&#039;s irregular for a reason. Go wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when things make contact with the Decay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only part of the object is put inside the Decay, then the part that was put inside it gets severed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that you fall into it? You life. After this one you pass away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, you are erased from existence. You don&#039;t go to The Grave, you don&#039;t go to any kind of afterlife, you&#039;re just gone, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do entities come out from The Decay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It&#039;s the lack of anything, why would they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are The Frontrooms affected by the Decay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The Frontrooms are not The Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can the Decay be stopped?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, but it can be slowed down. That&#039;s kinda the whole focal point of this canon though: How this thing could possibly be stopped. Don&#039;t shy away from writing attempts that didn&#039;t work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) No levels in The Backrooms are infinite in this canon, otherwise, it wouldn&#039;t be happening. If any levels rely on the fact that they are infinite, and they wouldn&#039;t work otherwise, then the Decay can just work it&#039;s way around that.&lt;br /&gt;
2) People age and can have children in The Backrooms in this canon. Biology still works even at the end of the world y&#039;all.&lt;br /&gt;
3) For the sake of the canon, reality bending entities &lt;strong&gt;do not exist&lt;/strong&gt;. Entities that can create matter infinitely, have total power over The Backrooms, or other kinds of that stuff may as well not even exist in this canon. If you still want them to be in this canon, they have to be made less powerful than they already were.&lt;br /&gt;
4) The Backrooms have reached a highly advanced state in this canon. The M.E.G. has access to some basic weapons, as well as the creation of electronics and the such. Current Backrooms population numbers at approximately six hundred thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A mysterious patch of darkness begins to spread around The Backrooms, taking all the nostalgic hellscapes and the entities that live in them with it. Different groups begin making unlikely allies in hopes of stopping the eventual death of The Backrooms, and the prioritization of finding an exit is emphasized the closer the backrooms gets to mass destruction.</p> <p>The main premise of the Decay Canon is hope and despair, and how the inhabitants go about facing an unknown evil that is greater than anything else they could've ever imagined. Strengths are found in common goals, and temporary peace is brought upon The Backrooms if only for a few precious moments. But in the end, is that enough to stop The Decay?</p> <p>The Canon is split into 4 parts, each detailing the progression of the spread and how it changes the world around it.</p> <h2><span><strong>Stage 1</strong></span></h2> <p>The beginning of the end. More and more reports come to the M.E.G's attention about a strange patch of void that seems to grow bigger with each passing moment. Struggling to verify these claims, the M.E.G does not give much care to it at first, but the blissful ignorance only lasts a small amount of time.</p> <p>Different explorer groups around The Backrooms begin reporting the same thing. More and more people start seeing the elusive patches of darkness, and eventually, they all come to the same conclusion:</p> <p>Something terribly evil has just begun</p> <h2><span><strong>Stage 2</strong></span></h2> <p>Now that the several different groups have noticed the spread, it is undeniable that something must be done about it. As the different groups of The Backrooms try to maintain relative normalcy as best as they can, they start researching several different methods of escaping The Backrooms.</p> <p>Several different explorations are made to the exit, as traversing the backrooms becomes harder and harder. The connections between levels begin to be severed, trapping the inhabitants inside. Transportation around the backrooms becomes a glaring issue as people begin to prepare for the worst.</p> <h2><span><strong>Stage 3</strong></span></h2> <p>Life in the backrooms as it was known has changed drastically. The different groups of The Backrooms have formed uneasy and desperate alliances with each other, and what once were the greatest of enemies have now banded together against the spread as one.</p> <p>The scramble for an exit grows all the more desperate, as entire levels have begun being consumed by The Decay. Entities of The Backrooms watch in dismay as their homes are destroyed, and the last secure vestiges of humanity are breaking down.</p> <p>The end times have grown near…</p> <h2><span><strong>Stage 4</strong></span></h2> <p>This is it. Singularity looms above The Backrooms with every passing day. Levels have almost all deteriorated completely, yet some beings still persist for some hope of survival. The last few humans watch cold and alone, knowing their days are numbered.</p> <p>Despair has taken over, nothingness reigns supreme, and the once glorious Backrooms are on their last knees.</p> <hr /></div> <div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none"> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>Non-tale entries</strong></span></h1> <p>Non-tale entries fall into 2 categories, 1) Normal entries affected by the events of Decay, or 2) Entries that exist solely because of Decay.</p> <p>For the former, write the article like you normally would, and find a way to link it to Decay. If an object before used to emit a light that melted people's hands off, then in the context of Decay it could perhaps also thwart the Decay in some form among other things. If an entity used to hate the M.E.G. for some reason, it could instead choose to ally itself with the opposing group for it's own purposes related to the Decay.</p> <p>For the latter, your article has to propose a different twist to the normal formula. What does this thing have to do with the Decay? Why does it fit into the canon, as in, what relations does it have to the story/characters? For example, you could write something like a material that was specifically created to thwart the Decay, or perhaps a Level that is the base of operations for a group of people who try to fight the Decay. There's lots of possibilities with this, and it's up to you to write them.</p> <p>It's an open canon after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>One-off tales</strong></span></h1> <p>First of all, before writing anything for the canon, consider this question.</p> <p>At what phase of the canon does your work fall into?</p> <p>Once you've answered that, plan your writing accordingly. What will your characters do that has to do with the Decay? What's the setting, and how is it affected by the Decay? What's the resolution of this tale?</p> <p>You also have to make sure that your tale does not contradict anything in the main series. That is the most important series of Decay, and tampering with the main series would fuck with the whole premise of Decay, since that series is the backbone of Decay.</p> <p>Keep all of these in mind, and once that is all planned out, you can begin writing. It's that simple!</p> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>Tale series</strong></span></h1> <p>This one is a tad bit more complicated.</p> <p>When writing a series, you don't have just one tale to keep track of, you have a whole system of characters and scenarios, and that can be a bit of an issue. You have to watch out for main series contradictions as mentioned earlier, albeit on a grander scale now. You also have to manage your characters over all the phases, as well as the scenes of the phases themselves. There's also the fact that you need to have a plot for it all as well. You can't just copy main series in the plot, so you have to be creative here as well!</p> <p>One fun thing about series however: Since the canon is in it's early stages, series separate from the main series will be able to interact with the main series in the future.</p> <p>If you plan on writing a series, then it is practically a necessity to contact me (SariaStuff) for details on planning it out. Reach out to me on discord or dms, and I will gladly explain how you can do it whilst also co-existing with the main series.</p> <hr /></div> <div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none"> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>Fonts</strong></span></h1> <p>For Josef''s font:<br /> <tt>[[module css]]</tt><br /> @import url('<a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nanum+Brush+Script&amp;display=swap">https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nanum+Brush+Script&amp;display=swap</a>');<br /> .Josef {<br /> font-family: 'Nanum Brush Script', cursive;<br /> }<br /> <tt>[[/module]]</tt></p> <blockquote> <p><span class="Josef">Place Text Here.</span></p> </blockquote> <p>The increasing of size is encouraged.

The only foreseeable issue that this may have is in the context of the other canon, and not Decay: Decay does not make sense from the perspective of other canons, especially considering the rules by which this canon plays by, not to mention the very premise of this canon which may be strange for the canon you are writing for.</p> <p>Regardless, if you still wish to go with it, make sure that it makes sense in the context of <strong>Decay</strong>, since the main attraction in Decay writing is Decay itself, so writing for other canons would mean that Decay has to take the spotlight.</p> <p>Should any further questions be needed about this matter, I urge you to contact me so we can clear them up.</p> <hr /></div> <div id="wiki-tab-0-4" style="display:none"> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>Questions</strong></span></h1> <h2><span><strong>What is the Decay?</strong></span></h2> <p>At face value, the Decay is a patch of darkness that spreads itself around The Backrooms, consuming everything it can spread on. It is both something and not: As in, it is the lack of matter, the lack of substance, but it is not entirely the <em>complete</em> lack of anything, it is still something, not entirely nothing (If that makes sense).</p> <p>As for what the Decay <em>actually</em> is, that's up to you to decide. No origin stories can or will be written for the origin of the Decay, so it's left up to interpretation. Want it to be created by general expansion of The Backrooms in the same vein as the heat death of the universe? Sure. Want it to be the product of some guy playing Nickelback really loudly which causes the world to rupture? Sure, like, why would you think that in the first place, but sure. It's basically left up for <em>you</em> to decide what made this thing. That's what's so fun about it!</p> <h2><span><strong>How does the spreading work?</strong></span></h2> <p>This one is a bit strange, so bear with me.</p> <p>I'll start of with the basic stuff, like spreading in general, speed of the spread, etc.</p> <p>The Decay spreads pretty slowly around The Backrooms on average. Whilst in some cases it can move a bit faster than its normal speed (i.e about a snail's pace max), most times will move at really slow speeds.</p> <p>The Decay spreads around The Backrooms by unknown means. As said earlier, it all relies on your headcanon, so it can be anything you want it to be.</p> <p>Does it spread onto living things? Yes, and no. I will not be elaborating further for the time being.</p> <p>And now, the most complicated part of this: How does it spread through the different states of matter? Here are my thoughts on that.</p> <ul> <li>In solids, the Decay spreads as mentioned earlier: Very slowly. It moves on the surfaces of the things it spreads onto, covering them, and essentially making them objects covered by portals to the void.</li> <li>In liquids, the Decay does not spread whatsoever, with exceptions being only those liquids that do not touch anything else (Think a floating patch of water in space, that's the kinda stuff I'm talking about).</li> <li>In gases, the Decay spreads only when a sizeable chunk of the surrounding area has been decayed, e.g, it won't begin to spread to the gases in a room until half of the room has been decayed. And even then, it still spreads as slow it does on solids</li> <li>This one is unique. The decay spreads the fastest in vacuums. Think about it: There is nothing in a vacuum, and the Decay is pretty much as close to nothing as you can get! Decay spreads instantly throughout vacuums, so good luck surviving in a place that's surrounded by them!</li> <li>What happens to irregular matter? No clue, it's irregular for a reason. Go wild.</li> </ul> <h2><span><strong>What happens when things make contact with the Decay?</strong></span></h2> <p>If only part of the object is put inside the Decay, then the part that was put inside it gets severed.</p> <p>In the case that you fall into it? You life. After this one you pass away.</p> <p>Jokes aside, you are erased from existence. You don't go to The Grave, you don't go to any kind of afterlife, you're just gone, never to be seen again.</p> <h2><span><strong>Do entities come out from The Decay?</strong></span></h2> <p>No. It's the lack of anything, why would they?</p> <h2><span><strong>Are The Frontrooms affected by the Decay?</strong></span></h2> <p>No. The Frontrooms are not The Backrooms.</p> <h2><span><strong>Can the Decay be stopped?</strong></span></h2> <p>No, but it can be slowed down. That's kinda the whole focal point of this canon though: How this thing could possibly be stopped. Don't shy away from writing attempts that didn't work!</p> <hr /> <h1><span><strong>Canon Rules</strong></span></h1> <p>1) No levels in The Backrooms are infinite in this canon, otherwise, it wouldn't be happening. If any levels rely on the fact that they are infinite, and they wouldn't work otherwise, then the Decay can just work it's way around that.<br /> 2) People age and can have children in The Backrooms in this canon. Biology still works even at the end of the world y'all.<br /> 3) For the sake of the canon, reality bending entities <strong>do not exist</strong>. Entities that can create matter infinitely, have total power over The Backrooms, or other kinds of that stuff may as well not even exist in this canon. If you still want them to be in this canon, they have to be made less powerful than they already were.<br /> 4) The Backrooms have reached a highly advanced state in this canon. The M.E.G. has access to some basic weapons, as well as the creation of electronics and the such. Current Backrooms population numbers at approximately six hundred thousand.</p> <hr /></div> </div> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h1><span><strong>Canon related articles</strong></span></h1> <p>Whether directly related to the canon, or only vaguely, these are the entries that form the story</p> <hr /> <div class="featurebox"> <h1><span><span style="color: #ffffff"><span style="font-size:200%;">Related articles</span></span></span></h1> <div class="featureflavor"> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Levels</strong></span><br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1-3">Level 1.3</a>: Malignance<br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-3">Level 6.3</a>: Vantablack<br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-326">Level 326</a>: Seared Frontier</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Entities</strong></span><br /> N/A</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Objects</strong></span><br /> N/A</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Phenomena</strong></span><br /> N/A</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>POIs</strong></span><br /> N/A</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>GOIs</strong></span><br /> N/A</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Themes</strong></span><br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:decay">Decay theme</a></p> <hr /></div> </div> <hr /> <div class="featurebox"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h1><span><span style="color: #ffffff"><span style="font-size:200%;">Main series</span></span></span></h1> </div> <div class="featureflavor"> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6864497&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713002" alt="Sariastuff" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6864497)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff" >Sariastuff</a></span><br /> <span style="font-size:125%;"><em>Josef-Megumi-Conor-Freya</em></span></p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Phase I</strong></span></p> <hr /> <p><a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/seed-of-darkness">Seed of Darkness</a><br /> <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/rendezvous">Rendezvous</a><br /> <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/something-strange-in-the-neighbourhood">Something Strange in The Neighbourhood</a><br /> <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/informed-opinion">Informed Opinion</a><br /> <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-haughty-virtuoso">The Haughty Virtuoso</a> -

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font: 3rem &#039;Mate SC&#039;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Broken City: Chapter One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;City Boy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Max, get up.&amp;quot; said a voice to Max. Max turned in bed, facing away from the noise, inaudibly muttering and groaning. &amp;quot;Max come on! Get your butt out of bed, we&#039;ve got work to do today!&amp;quot; it said once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max rolled around once more. &amp;quot;Give me 5 more minutes, let me just sleep in ple&amp;#8212;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was interrupted mid-sentence. &amp;quot;MAX! WE HAVE WORK TO DO! GET UP, NOW!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got up suddenly, alarmed by the sudden change in the voice&#039;s tone. Wide-awake, he looked at the source of the voice: His roommate, partner in the M.E.G., and friend, Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, fine.&amp;quot; Max grumbled. He reached to the drawer beside his bed, searching for his glasses with his hand. He put them on as soon as he found them, his vision finally clearing up. He looked to his side as Alex opened a curtain to let in some light, causing the brightness of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt; to pour into the apartment. Nothing could beat a fresh ray of sunlight in the morning &amp;#8212; or at least whatever caused the light within Level 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex threw Max his uniform, a black polo with the M.E.G. logo on the chest. &amp;quot;Get yourself ready to go. One of the Base leaders summoned us to his office today.&amp;quot; Ordered Alex as he slipped his shirt on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please don&#039;t tell me its Bill.&amp;quot; Max sighed, still somewhat groggy from getting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You guessed it.&amp;quot; Alex sighed half-heartedly. Max rolled his eyes, letting out a long groan of annoyance. He walked into the bathroom, for once in his lifetime bothering to look presentable. He brushed his teeth, did his hair, and put on some cologne and deodorant. He then put on a pair of denim jeans, looked at the mirror on last time, and exited the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex smiled towards his direction with a wry smile. &amp;quot;Wow, your hair isn&#039;t a curly mess for once.&amp;quot; she said playfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#039;t get used to it.&amp;quot; Max replied, chuckling at the taunt. He took a big bag which Alex handed to him, opening it up to find it was full of an assortment of weapons and supplies. He put the bag on his back, put on his shoes, and zipped up his jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair walked to the front door, ready to start their day. Max looked back at the apartment once more, scanning a mental checklist to make sure he hadn&#039;t left anything behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked back towards Alex. &amp;quot;You done yet?&amp;quot; she asked him impatiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess so. Do we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go see Bill today? I really don&#039;t want to.&amp;quot; Max whined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex looked at him straight in the eye, a look of utter dread plastered on her face. &amp;quot;Unfortunately, yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can we at least get coffee first? I need the caffeine boost to put up with Bill.&amp;quot; Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If this goes well, then we can get coffee. How does that sound?&amp;quot; Alex replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deal.&amp;quot; Max replied with renewed enthusiasm. They locked the door of their apartment behind them, and proceeded down the long hallway of the apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What does Bill want us to do exactly? I heard you say it had something to do with The Snackrooms.&amp;quot; Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude, you&#039;re an M.E.G. agent, refer to levels by their numbers. And to answer your question, he said he would tell us there. I think it&#039;s something to do with making sure the B.N.T.G. trading outposts are doing well and not turning into capitalist hierarchies, et cetera et cetera&amp;#8230; You know, the usual check-ups.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let out a sigh. &amp;quot;Let&#039;s just get this over with.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max and Alex began descending down the stairs. There was an elevator that they could&#039;ve used, but they knew better not to use it &amp;#8212; &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-81&quot;&gt;just in case&lt;/a&gt;. After reaching the bottom of the stairs, they greeted the Faceling receptionist, and exited the large apartment complex. Max loved basking in the sunlight of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;. He missed the real sun, and this was probably the closest he could get to it. As much as he appreciated how close it was to the real sun, something just never felt right about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They walked down the streets of the endless city, greeting wanderers and Facelings who walked by them as they made their way towards Base Beta. Base Beta was one of the largest skyscrapers within the general area, claimed by the M.E.G. as one of their most important bases. Certain floors were restricted to common folk, being only available to members with sufficient clearance. Soon enough, their journey was over, and they made it to the towering skyscraper. As they entered the building, they were greeted by a receptionist, who was also wearing the same black polo shirt as Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Names?&amp;quot; the receptionist asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alexandra. Resident of Level 11, agent #08412&amp;quot; Alex responded in a serious tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, I&#039;ll just jot this down&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; the receptionist said, typing her information into the computer. &amp;quot;And you?&amp;quot; he said, looking at Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh&amp;#8230; Max. Resident of Level 11, agent&amp;#8230; uhh&amp;#8230; hold on a &#039;sec&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Max mumbled as he searched his shirt pocket for the paper he kept of his agent number. Alex put her head in her hands and sighed. Max unfolded the paper and read it, adjusting his glasses. &amp;quot;Agent #41980&amp;quot; Max finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you. Let me just check you in.&amp;quot; The receptionist responded. He typed a few things into the computer while Max and Alex waited patiently. &amp;quot;Alright, I can see you&#039;re here for an appointment with Base Leader Bill, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. He summoned us to his office this morning.&amp;quot; Alex responded. Max laughed internally at how official Alex acted during M.E.G. affairs. It always made him chuckle a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, let me just do a Skin-Stealer test&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; The receptionist responded, getting up from his seat. He took a small object and placed it over Max&#039;s finger. Max grunted as it pricked him, causing a droplet of blood to seep out of his finger. &amp;quot;Alright, you&#039;re good.&amp;quot; He muttered. He proceeded to do the same to Alex. Seeing both of their blood drops were red, the receptionist nodded in satisfaction. &amp;quot;Alrighty, you&#039;re not Skin-Stealers. Walk through that metal detector, and you should be clear to proceed up the staircase. Go no further than floor 3, and hand the guard this badge to be let in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receptionist gave Max and Alex two visitor badges, one for each of them. They both nodded, heading for the doorway with the metal detectors and beginning to make their way to Bill&#039;s room. They made sure to leave their bags with the receptionist, since weapons were not allowed in the building. They walked up the staircase of the huge skyscraper until they reached floor 3, which was guarded by an M.E.G. operative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please display your passes and reason of visiting.&amp;quot; the guard ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#039;re here to visit Base Leader Bill. He summoned us to his office.&amp;quot; Alex responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guard nodded, letting them into the hallway. &amp;quot;Good luck.&amp;quot; He chuckled. They walked down the hallway of the offices of all the Base Leaders. Base Leaders were nothing special: The only thing that separated them from a regular M.E.G. member was their ability to boss said members around within the divisions of levels that they commanded. After reaching the office labelled Base Leader Bill Reddinson, they paused in front of the door, knocking on it and waiting for a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who&#039;s thewe?&amp;quot; A high pitched voice called from the other side of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alex and Max, we&#039;re here because you asked us to come over yesterday.&amp;quot; Alex replied, shouting to make herself heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ahh, Awex and Max, come on in.&amp;quot; said the voice once more. Max walked into a familiar looking office, immediately stepping onto a plush, red carpet. The wallpapers were colored a mahogany brown, and they were adorned with framed pictures of several mementos of the owner&#039;s life. Several bookshelves stood poised near the walls, all a meager two shelves long, specifically made for the owner in question: A five year old boy, who was currently standing next to a small filing cabinet, organizing what looked to be highly important documents. He walked towards a large, leather office chair, and climbed onto it with some struggle. With some effort, he reached to the desk, turned on a small fan, and arranged a sign with his name on it in the front of his desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Morning Bill. Seems like a busy day, eh?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, it wooks wike it.&amp;quot; He said, breathing in deeply after the tremendous task of getting onto his chair. &amp;quot;Awight, I have cawwed you two up here for a &lt;em&gt;vewy&lt;/em&gt; impowtant task.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is the &#039;impowtant task&#039; Bill?&amp;quot; Asked Max, who was holding back tears at this point. Alex lightly elbowed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want you to go to 6.1 and write a fowmal weport on the ten B.N.T.G. twading outposts to make sure they are up to standard, and that no shady deawings are going on.&amp;quot; He ordered. He handed them both clipboards with multiple blank questionnaires on them, along with an attached pen. &amp;quot;Make sure you use pwofessional tone, descwibe it pwoperwy, and use wegible handwiting. I need to be able to wead it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m surprised you&#039;re old enough to read.&amp;quot; Max muttered under his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill glared at him. &amp;quot;I am 65 years owd, I&#039;m pwetty sure I can wead. Can we pwease not bwing up da &#039;accident&#039;? Show some wespect to yow supewiors.&amp;quot; Bill ordered. Max nodded, holding back a snicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Awight.&amp;quot; Max mocked, purposely mispronouncing his r&#039;s and I&#039;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you please take this seriously?&amp;quot; Alex grumbled quietly. Bill glared at him with a resentful gaze in his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anyways, I won&#039;t keep you much wonger. I expect these weports back soon.&amp;quot; Bill commanded. Alex nodded. Bill glared at Max. &amp;quot;This is a sewious assignment. No jokes, no insuwts about my cuwwent &amp;#8212; hopefuwwy tempowary &amp;#8212; appeawance, and no iwwewevant, half-baked weports.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes sir. I&#039;ll make sure he abides by those orders.&amp;quot; she replied, glancing at Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anyways, get to it. I have owganization tasks to take cawe wof.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Promptly, sir.&amp;quot; Alex grabbed Max and lead him out of the office, shutting the door behind her. As soon as they got within a far enough range from Bill&#039;s office that they could not be heard, Max let out all the laughter he had been bottling in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you please take things seriously for once? Is it that difficult?&amp;quot; Alex sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes ma&#039;am.&amp;quot; Max responded, completely mocking her with a highly exaggerated, serious voice. He gave a salute as a further jest. She rolled her eyes in response and beckoned him forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting their bags and exiting the skyscraper, they proceeded back down the infinite confines of the city. Many different shops, buildings, and group headquarters caught their eyes as they strolled down the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alex, you really need to lighten up. &amp;quot; Max snickered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll &#039;lighten up&#039; when you start taking M.E.G. affairs seriously and stop disrespecting the Base Leaders.&amp;quot; Alex responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alex, he literally got turned into a five year old.&amp;quot; Max chuckled. Alex cracked a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, fine. It was a little funny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that, wait, emotion?!&amp;quot; Max taunted. She elbowed him in reply, still smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex scrolled through her handheld tablet to get directions to the nearest 6.1 entrance point. In the meantime, Max skimmed through the questionnaire reports Bill had given them, staring at the paper with a dull, bored gaze, as if wishing it would just vanish right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How much farther is it? I wanna get this crap done quickly so we can go and actually enjoy our day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;According to my tablet&#039;s directions, this restaurant further down the road should lead us straight into Level 6.1.&amp;quot; Alex responded. She looked up from her tablet and pointed towards an Asian-looking restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, let&#039;s get this over with.&amp;quot; Max sighed. The two entered the restaurant, immediately passing through the floor into Level 6.1. They fell through the ceiling, landing on the hard, concrete floor of Level 6.1 with a thud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m never going to get used to that.&amp;quot; Max muttered, slightly disoriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s weird at first, but eventually you stop getting sick after every clip.&amp;quot; Alex responded. They gazed upon the long, linear hallway of never-ending restaurants, all filled to the brim with wanderers. Several outposts of different people were scattered around, each trying to offer trades for their wares or show adverts to wanderers that roamed the long pathway, with restaurants on one side, and red concrete walls on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I asked if we could get coffee before we dealt with Bill, and we didn&#039;t get any whatsoever. We&#039;re gonna deal with the B.N.T.G. in a minute, so I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; need that boost now. Can we actually get some this time?&amp;quot; Max said with a hopeful tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine,&amp;quot; Alex replied. &amp;quot;Let&#039;s just go into one of these restaurants near here. This one sound good to you?&amp;quot; She said, pointing at a small café only a few steps away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I could care less where we go, I just want coffee.&amp;quot; Max sighed in relief, his stomach roaring like an angry lion. They walked into one of the restaurants labeled &amp;quot;The Scrambled Eggs Café&amp;quot; and seated themselves at a table. A Faceling walked up to them, handing them each a menu and a set of silverware. It pointed at its name tag, which read out &#039;Griselda FerrdenShmurr&#039;. Max squinted at the name tag, figuring out how to pronounce it, confused why the Facelings always had such strange names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Morning Griselda!&amp;quot; Max smiled politely. The Faceling grunted happily in reply. It looked down at a small tablet and slowly typed something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello. It is nice to meet you.&amp;quot; A robotic, text-to-speech voice spoke out of the tablet. Max smiled at the scene, in awe at how cool it all seemed. The Faceling walked back to the kitchen as the two scoured the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once we&#039;re done, we get straight back to work.&amp;quot; Alex reminded him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know.&amp;quot; Max replied. &amp;quot;Let&#039;s not worry about that for now. So what are you having?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A faint sound could be heard from far down the long hallway of Level 6.1. It sounded like a distressed scream, as if an animal was being killed, but with a hint of anger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two B.N.T.G. members stood at one of their trading outposts, quieting down upon hearing their screams. &amp;quot;What the heck is that?&amp;quot; said one of them to the other. &amp;quot;You&#039;re hearing that right?&amp;quot; The other shrugged at their companion. They kept listening for a while, the screaming continuously getting louder, until the one that spoke decided he&#039;d investigate the source of the noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He stepped away from his station, and onto the long pathway of Level 6.1. Far down the path, the source of the noise could be made out, and it was approaching fast. His eyes widened when he realized the thing that was screaming wasn&#039;t a thing, but rather, a person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He turned to his companion. &amp;quot;Mike, hand me the crossbow, we&#039;ve got a situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mike bent down, obeying the order, picking up the crossbow, and passing it to his friend. &amp;quot;Dude, what is that thing?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other agent, Terry, looked at the person running towards them, who was getting closer by the second. &amp;quot;I don&#039;t know what that thing is, but I&#039;ve got a bad feeling about this&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the figure got closer, he saw that it was a woman. She had black, waist-long hair, with parts of it dyed with light blue streaks. She donned a grey sweater, and an equally grey pair of sweatpants, with white sneakers standing in contrast with her clothes. Perhaps the most peculiar thing about her was a dark, inky substance that was coming out of her mouth like a faucet. She carried a small pouch with her, which seemed to be full of various loose objects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she got within shooting distance, Terry steadied his crossbow, and shouted out a command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me lady,&amp;quot; He boomed loudly and sternly, &amp;quot;I&#039;m going to have to ask you to stop right there!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The woman, still screaming like at the top of her lungs, ignored him, continuing her sprint towards the area. As she got closer, she reached into her bag and pulled out a small red crystal, tossing it towards the duo. As soon as it made contact with the ground, it exploded, blasting them both into the air. Terry hit the ground hard, his vision blurry as he struggled to get up. He looked one last time at the screaming woman as she continued her mad dash across the level, and then he blacked out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max&#039;s eating was interrupted by a sudden shockwave from somewhere nearby. He paused his chewing, looking at Alex as if to confirm what he had just heard. He then heard wild, rabid screaming coming from the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that screaming?&amp;quot; Alex asked him as she also paused her eating, looking up from her food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Should we&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, we definitely should.&amp;quot; Alex finished. She got up from her seat and began exiting the restaurant, Max following close behind. She looked towards Griselda&#039;s direction, calling out a quick &amp;quot;We&#039;ll be back soon!&amp;quot; before heading back out into the main path to investigate. The scene they saw before them was complete and utter bedlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several different patrons from various different restaurants ran around, all running away from a wild-looking woman who was assaulting random wanderers with various different weapons. M.E.G. agents surrounded her, each one attempting to shoot her with a standard-issue crossbow, but they were unable to hit her, as she evaded each one of them with inhuman speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching into the same pouch from which she got the crystal, she pulled out a small, black baton. She then proceeded to press a button on it, which extended it into a long, kendo-stick like weapon, which was almost as tall as her, and required the usage of both hands for her to hold. Blue bolts of electricity seemed to come out from it, their full force demonstrated as she hit an M.E.G. agent who was running towards her. When she whacked him with the stick, he fell to the ground unconscious, part of his hair singed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&amp;quot; The woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She turned around, whacking yet another agent unconscious, and hitting him once again when he fell to the ground, burning a sizeable part of his skin. Another nearby agent ran up behind her, firing a taser at her with the hopes of stunning her. Unluckily for him, she managed to thwart the wires with the stick, proceeding to then hit him with it. She then quickly walked over to one of the fallen agents, picking up their crossbow, and firing it at the thigh of yet another agent. This caused them to fall to the ground and yelp in pain, which rendered them immobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woah woah woah woah!&amp;quot; Max called out. &amp;quot;What in the world is going on here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stay back, I&#039;ll handle this.&amp;quot; Alex ordered, sticking her hand in front of Max. Sinclair fired an arrow at Alex, who proceeded to just narrowly avoid the arrow, the rush created by it blowing a small patch of her hair up. Alex reached into her bag, grabbing a small throwing star. She threw it at the woman, striking her in the arm, which caused the woman to drop her crossbow and yelp in pain, effectively stopping her screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?!&amp;quot; Max called out, ignoring Alex&#039;s order. He approached the woman, who bled profusely out of her shoulder. She stared at the ground, her greasy, black hair covering her face. Her breathing was extremely heavy and labored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; she said through heavy, unrhythmic gasps for breaths. &amp;quot;could you&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, what did you say?&amp;quot; Max asked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HOW COULD YOU?!&amp;quot; the woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She pushed past Alex, knocking her onto the floor, and leapt at Max. The full weight of her body knocked them both to the floor. The woman then put Max in a headlock, and pulled out a small dagger, putting the sharp side against his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait! Please!&amp;quot; Alex called out, her eyes widening in desperation. The woman cackled like a crazy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen here lady. You tell me what you filthy meggies did to our church, and I don&#039;t slice up your boyfriend&#039;s neck!&amp;quot; She threatened, with a heavy amount of lunacy in her voice. Her greasy, black hair covered half of her face, the uncovered part showing the crazy woman&#039;s bloodlusted face in full-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you talking about lady? We didn&#039;t do anything! And he is not my boyfriend!&amp;quot; Alex yelled, raising her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;TELL ME!&amp;quot; The woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She poked the tip of the blade into Max&#039;s neck, causing a tiny drop of blood to pour out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait! Please!&amp;quot; Alex cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have ten seconds before I carve him up like a Thanksgiving turkey!&amp;quot; The woman growled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please! We didn&#039;t do anything to you!&amp;quot; Alex screamed with desperation in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ten!&amp;quot; She snarled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lady! We didn&#039;t do anything!&amp;quot; Max yelled angrily. He attempted to elbow her in the stomach, but it did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nine!&amp;quot; She screamed. Max kept struggling. Alex looked around, not sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eight!&amp;quot; She yelled, her voice getting louder and crazier as the count got lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Screw you lady!&amp;quot; Max exclaimed, struggling for his life, unable to break free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m bored, let&#039;s skip to the good part! ONE!&amp;quot; She howled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NO!&amp;quot; Alex screamed. The woman lifted her knife to pierce Max&#039;s neck, screaming with rage. She thrust her blade towards his neck, stopping abruptly a few inches away from it. She loosened her grip on Max, who got out of her loosening headlock, quickly crawling towards Alex. The woman reached behind her and pulled a small dart out of her arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aw come o&amp;#8212;&amp;quot; The woman mumbled before collapsing to the floor unconscious. Alex watched as the agent who threw the dart approached the woman from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tranquilizer darts, aren&#039;t they wonderful?&amp;quot; The agent snickered, laughing at his own joke. Max and Alex sighed in relief. They looked at the unconscious woman, black ink still oozing from her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max turned towards Alex with a wry smile. &amp;quot;So you do care about me, huh?&amp;quot; he teased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you, I was handling it.&amp;quot; Alex grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#039;t be all serious again, I see you holding back those tears.&amp;quot; Max smiled. Alex cracked a small smile, and then elbowed him in the gut. She let one single tear escape her eyes, relieved that her friend was still alive and kicking. They got off the ground and inspected the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who the heck is this lady anyways? What was she on about?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair Beckett; the most infamous Follower of Jerry.&amp;quot; The agent responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is Sinclair?&amp;quot; Max asked with a tinge of disappointment in his voice. &amp;quot;I&amp;#8230; kinda expected more to be honest&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m not sure what she was on about, but she&#039;s done stuff like this before. It&#039;s usually because she thinks we&#039;re responsible for some stuff that happened to their cult, I don&#039;t know. Anyways, I&#039;ve got a med team coming from Level 11 to treat all the injured people. She nastied them up real good.&amp;quot; The agent sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Max and I will deal with Sinclair. You go help the med team.&amp;quot; Alex replied. The agent nodded, and went to go wake up the victims of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll go ask for some take-out boxes.&amp;quot; Max added, walking back into the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair woke up in a dark room on a cold, metal chair. She attempted to stand up, but her arms were held down by metal cuffs. She started shaking violently, attempting to free herself of her restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Finally awake, huh?&amp;quot; Max said, somewhat condescendingly, sitting next to Alex on the other side of the dimly lit room. Sinclair calmed her struggling and glared at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happened to our little agreement?&amp;quot; Sinclair snarled, ink drooling from her mouth. Her long, messy hair covered half her face, alleviating Max from seeing the other half of her face, which had a hateful look plastered on it. &amp;quot;You don&#039;t bother us, and we don&#039;t bother you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hypocrite! You came out of nowhere and assaulted multiple agents, causing a complete scene on 6.1!&amp;quot; Alex replied. He moved towards a pile of papers he had sitting on the table, picked them up, and began reading them out to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Two B.N.T.G. agents have severe second degree burns, and one of them has a broken vertebrate. Nine M.E.G. agents have gotten blunt force trauma to their heads, and small burns from the electricity of the taser stick you assaulted them with. Another agent has a bad crossbow wound in their thigh, and the doctors aren&#039;t sure if she&#039;ll walk without a limp for the rest of her life. Four other agents are currently undergoing the effects of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-48&quot;&gt;Liquid Pain&lt;/a&gt; due to those little needles you were throwing at them. Then, you almost killed me! These are serious allegations, some of these guys will be in the hospital for months, and the liquid pain victims will probably have to be euthanized! Are you aware of the weight of these atrocities?!&amp;quot; Max ranted. Sinclair chuckled, a slight hint of lunacy in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re lucky I couldn&#039;t do any more. After what you scumbag meggies did to our chur&amp;#8212;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you on about?! We did nothing of the sort to any church!&amp;quot; Max exclaimed, slamming his hand on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;LIAR!&amp;quot; Sinclair screamed, shaking violently in the chair, slamming her head against the back of the seat. After she ceased the gyrations, she stared at Max with inhuman rage in her eyes. &amp;quot;I walked back into our home, our place of worship, to see the end of it completely enveloped in black void. What did you do?&amp;quot; Sinclair asked through clenched teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-274&quot;&gt;Jerry&#039;s Room&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that what you people call it? What an original name.&amp;quot; Sinclair snarled sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait&amp;#8230; You&#039;re saying Jerry&#039;s room is being consumed by some sort of black void?&amp;quot; Alex asked, her eyes widened slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! So you figured it out!&amp;quot; Sinclair snarked with an overly peppy voice. Alex opened her mouth as if to say something, but she closed it again, opting to remain silent for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&#039;s not good.&amp;quot; Alex whispered under her breath. &amp;quot;Give me a minute, I gotta go make some calls.&amp;quot; Alex stood up from her chair and pulled out a small cell phone from her bag. Before she exited the room completely, Max heard her dial up Bill, telling him that they&#039;d have to postpone the report for a while. Then she closed the door, leaving just him and Sinclair alone in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max stared at Sinclair, and she stared back at him, ink still oozing out of her mouth. He said nothing for as long as they maintained eye contact, but as he observed her, he couldn&#039;t help but feel slightly disgusted at the scene before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why don&#039;t you take a picture? It&#039;ll last longer.&amp;quot; She remarked aggressively. Max didn&#039;t respond to her taunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minute or two later, Alex walked back in. &amp;quot;Alright, I told Bill that Sinclair came and attacked a bunch of people, and that we need to bring her back to Jerry&#039;s room. I didn&#039;t talk about the void thing, because I don&#039;t want the overseers sticking their noses into this. We&#039;re just going to go figure out what the heck is going on, and see if there&#039;s any way to stop it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, so we&#039;re going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You got it. Pack your things, we&#039;re leaving as soon as the other agents arr- wait, nevermind, here they are, I guess.&amp;quot; She said as three other agents walked into the room. &amp;quot;That was quick.&amp;quot; She exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, uh, what about Coocoo for Cocoa Puffs over there, is she coming with us?&amp;quot; One of the agents muttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#039;ve confiscated her bag of weapons so she doesn&#039;t pull anything funny. If she does, we can just stun her with a taser so she doesn&#039;t knock us all out again.&amp;quot; Alex replied, glaring at Sinclair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She approached Sinclair and looked down at her. &amp;quot;You try anything, and you get zapped out of your life.&amp;quot; She threatened, showing off her taser. Alex bent down next to her handcuffs, releasing Sinclair from the restraints, freeing her from her imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine, I&#039;ll behave, but only because I want to know what&#039;s going on.&amp;quot; She growled, standing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I really do not want to go back to Level 0. The smell there is &lt;em&gt;disgusting&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; Max complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trust me, Level 0 is much better than a place like Level 5 or 7.&amp;quot; Alex replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you stupid meggies use numbers for levels? That&#039;s so weird. Just call it the Terror Hotel, or Thalassophobia.&amp;quot; Sinclair scoffed condescendingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It sounds more official to use the numbers. Now come on, we have lots of walking to do.&amp;quot; Alex replied. &amp;quot;There&#039;s a room here that usually brings you to Level 0 if you successfully clip through the wall. We just have to all go through at the same time so we don&#039;t get separated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of agents and Sinclair walked down a hallway of the large skyscraper, Alex leading the way. She peeked inside each room, looking for the entrance, whilst Sinclair walked next to Max, who had an angry vengeful look pointed towards him for the whole trip. After a few minutes, a faint buzzing noise could be heard down the hallway. They followed the noise until they finally made it to a room where the noise was much louder compared to the other rooms they&#039;d been to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this it?&amp;quot; Max asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Looks like it.&amp;quot; Alex replied looking into the room. It was a dimly lit office room with no furniture inside of it, save for a singular, sad, buzzing fluorescent light, which buzzed much louder than it usually would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That stupid buzzing, I hate it.&amp;quot; Max sighed, dreading the hours in its midst that he would soon have to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, listen. We need to perform a controlled clip into Level 0 in a very strategic way so that we don&#039;t get separated millions of miles apart. If we all hold hands and successfully pass through the wall, we should hopefully all end up in the same place. Ready?&amp;quot; Alex asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As much as I possibly can be knowing what awaits me, yeah.&amp;quot; Max sighed. The whole crew grabbed hands, Sinclair included, as they prepared to pass through the wall. Alex pressed it with her hand a few times, before bumping her body into it. She repeated this a few times until her hand phased through the wall. She thrust her body into it, passing through it precisely as to not break the clip, all of them following suit behind in the same fashion as Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it was entirely pitch black around Max. He felt as if he was floating through an empty void, his only connection to the world being the hands he was holding. The whole experience was extremely nauseating. Thankfully, it did not last long, as they quickly found themselves falling onto the nasty, damp carpets of Level 0. The noise of buzzing fluorescent lights overpowered any other sound in the whole place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, here we are. Good ol&#039; Level 0.&amp;quot; Max sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cut it meggie, I live here!.&amp;quot; Sinclair snarked. &amp;quot;Now stop all your stuffy commanding and ordering around, and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; lead the way. I know this place like the back of my hand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How is that even possible? All the rooms are identical!&amp;quot; Alex asked as they began to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m not talking about the layout, I&#039;m talking about how to work this place. Watch and learn, princess.&amp;quot; Sinclair taunted. She looked around the room, taking in the scene before her: The rotted yellow wallpaper, the disgusting carpet, and the overwhelming buzzing sound. She beckoned the group forward as she gazed around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; Alex asked impatiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut it.&amp;quot; Sinclair replied. She looked to her right. &amp;quot;Over here.&amp;quot; She pointed at the wall. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first, until she pointed out a subtle difference from the other parts of the walls. &amp;quot;Slightly darker shade of yellow, carpet isn&#039;t nearly as wet. I wouldn&#039;t expect you to know about these things.&amp;quot; Sinclair remarked, receiving a glare from Alex in return. Sinclair walked through the wall with ease, before sticking her head back though. &amp;quot;Coming?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex sighed and passed through the wall, the others following behind. They proceeded to walk through room after room for a few hours, clipping through walls here and there to get to the fabled room of Jerry. After many long hours of repetitive rooms, they finally stumbled across a normal looking door, which was very out of place for Level 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you find that in only a few hours? This would take regular people years to find!&amp;quot; Max exclaimed shockingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ve been here for a while. You learn to figure things out.&amp;quot; Sinclair replied. They stared at the door, which was very basic looking, even when compared to other doors in The Backrooms. Sinclair opened the door, which lead into a large lounge with couches, desks, dining rooms, and pictures of a blue parrot all around the room. A group of people relaxed on a number of the couches, each one in clad blue robes with golden markings on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sinclair! Why are you bringing lost ones into our church?&amp;quot; one of them exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Relax, they&#039;re here to check out the void. After some&amp;#8230; forced negotiation, they came with me to inspect the area.&amp;quot; Sinclair replied. She walked over to one of the minifridges and pulled out a small vial of black ink, consuming its contents immediately. The rest of the crew looked at her in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you mind&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230; leading us to the &#039;void&#039; thing?&amp;quot; Max asked. Sinclair licked her lips, completely ignoring Max as she called out to the other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yo Macy! You got someone who wants to see you!&amp;quot; Sinclair screamed down the corner of the wall. Max&#039;s heart dropped at the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; He whispered to himself. &amp;quot;If that&#039;s who I think it is&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; Three people stepped from around the corner. One was a man, his lower face masked by what looked like a plastic bird beak. His skin was entirely covered by a slightly ridiculous looking bird costume, which seemed to give his skin a blue tinge. Max couldn&#039;t verify that his skin was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; blue however, as most of it was covered by said costume. The second wore a robe similar to her other members, but it was colored a dazzling gold instead of blue. She was short, her face covered entirely by the hood. On the golden robed individual sat a blue bird &amp;#8212; &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7&quot;&gt;Jerry&lt;/a&gt; himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who did you bring this time, Sinclair?&amp;quot; Jerry squawked, to the surprise of Max and Alex. He sounded like a typical parrot, but the fact that he could string together whole sentences was slightly shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meggies&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; The masked man scoffed in disgust, looking at the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden-robed person was trembling. &amp;quot;Wait&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; She whispered. She lowered her hood to reveal a short-haired, chubby cheeked woman. She was flabbergasted, seeming to be in utter shock and awe at the scene that stood before her. &amp;quot;Max?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max&#039;s heart dropped as he realized who it was. Through shaky breaths, he only managed to utter a singular word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Macy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Max turned in bed, facing away from the noise, inaudibly muttering and groaning. &quot;Max come on! Get your butt out of bed, we've got work to do today!&quot; it said once again.</p> <p>Max rolled around once more. &quot;Give me 5 more minutes, let me just sleep in ple&#8212;&quot;</p> <p>He was interrupted mid-sentence. &quot;MAX! WE HAVE WORK TO DO! GET UP, NOW!&quot;</p> <p>He got up suddenly, alarmed by the sudden change in the voice's tone. Wide-awake, he looked at the source of the voice: His roommate, partner in the M.E.G., and friend, Alex.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, fine.&quot; Max grumbled. He reached to the drawer beside his bed, searching for his glasses with his hand. He put them on as soon as he found them, his vision finally clearing up. He looked to his side as Alex opened a curtain to let in some light, causing the brightness of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a> to pour into the apartment. Nothing could beat a fresh ray of sunlight in the morning &#8212; or at least whatever caused the light within Level 11.</p> <p>Alex threw Max his uniform, a black polo with the M.E.G. logo on the chest. &quot;Get yourself ready to go. One of the Base leaders summoned us to his office today.&quot; Ordered Alex as he slipped his shirt on.</p> <p>&quot;Please don't tell me its Bill.&quot; Max sighed, still somewhat groggy from getting up.</p> <p>&quot;You guessed it.&quot; Alex sighed half-heartedly. Max rolled his eyes, letting out a long groan of annoyance. He walked into the bathroom, for once in his lifetime bothering to look presentable. He brushed his teeth, did his hair, and put on some cologne and deodorant. He then put on a pair of denim jeans, looked at the mirror on last time, and exited the bathroom.</p> <p>Alex smiled towards his direction with a wry smile. &quot;Wow, your hair isn't a curly mess for once.&quot; she said playfully.</p> <p>&quot;Don't get used to it.&quot; Max replied, chuckling at the taunt. He took a big bag which Alex handed to him, opening it up to find it was full of an assortment of weapons and supplies. He put the bag on his back, put on his shoes, and zipped up his jacket.</p> <p>The pair walked to the front door, ready to start their day. Max looked back at the apartment once more, scanning a mental checklist to make sure he hadn't left anything behind.</p> <p>He looked back towards Alex. &quot;You done yet?&quot; she asked him impatiently.</p> <p>&quot;I guess so. Do we <em>have</em> to go see Bill today? I really don't want to.&quot; Max whined.</p> <p>Alex looked at him straight in the eye, a look of utter dread plastered on her face. &quot;Unfortunately, yes.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Can we at least get coffee first? I need the caffeine boost to put up with Bill.&quot; Max asked.</p> <p>&quot;If this goes well, then we can get coffee. How does that sound?&quot; Alex replied.</p> <p>&quot;Deal.&quot; Max replied with renewed enthusiasm. They locked the door of their apartment behind them, and proceeded down the long hallway of the apartment building.</p> <p>&quot;What does Bill want us to do exactly? I heard you say it had something to do with The Snackrooms.&quot; Max asked.</p> <p>&quot;Dude, you're an M.E.G. agent, refer to levels by their numbers. And to answer your question, he said he would tell us there. I think it's something to do with making sure the B.N.T.G. trading outposts are doing well and not turning into capitalist hierarchies, et cetera et cetera&#8230; You know, the usual check-ups.&quot;</p> <p>He let out a sigh. &quot;Let's just get this over with.&quot;</p> <p>Max and Alex began descending down the stairs. There was an elevator that they could've used, but they knew better not to use it &#8212; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-81">just in case</a>. After reaching the bottom of the stairs, they greeted the Faceling receptionist, and exited the large apartment complex. Max loved basking in the sunlight of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>. He missed the real sun, and this was probably the closest he could get to it. As much as he appreciated how close it was to the real sun, something just never felt right about it.</p> <p>They walked down the streets of the endless city, greeting wanderers and Facelings who walked by them as they made their way towards Base Beta. Base Beta was one of the largest skyscrapers within the general area, claimed by the M.E.G. as one of their most important bases. Certain floors were restricted to common folk, being only available to members with sufficient clearance. Soon enough, their journey was over, and they made it to the towering skyscraper. As they entered the building, they were greeted by a receptionist, who was also wearing the same black polo shirt as Max.</p> <p>&quot;Names?&quot; the receptionist asked.</p> <p>&quot;Alexandra. Resident of Level 11, agent #08412&quot; Alex responded in a serious tone.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, I'll just jot this down&#8230;&quot; the receptionist said, typing her information into the computer. &quot;And you?&quot; he said, looking at Max.</p> <p>&quot;Uh&#8230; Max. Resident of Level 11, agent&#8230; uhh&#8230; hold on a 'sec&#8230;&quot; Max mumbled as he searched his shirt pocket for the paper he kept of his agent number. Alex put her head in her hands and sighed. Max unfolded the paper and read it, adjusting his glasses. &quot;Agent #41980&quot; Max finished.</p> <p>&quot;Thank you. Let me just check you in.&quot; The receptionist responded. He typed a few things into the computer while Max and Alex waited patiently. &quot;Alright, I can see you're here for an appointment with Base Leader Bill, right?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yes. He summoned us to his office this morning.&quot; Alex responded. Max laughed internally at how official Alex acted during M.E.G. affairs. It always made him chuckle a bit.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, let me just do a Skin-Stealer test&#8230;&quot; The receptionist responded, getting up from his seat. He took a small object and placed it over Max's finger. Max grunted as it pricked him, causing a droplet of blood to seep out of his finger. &quot;Alright, you're good.&quot; He muttered. He proceeded to do the same to Alex. Seeing both of their blood drops were red, the receptionist nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Alrighty, you're not Skin-Stealers. Walk through that metal detector, and you should be clear to proceed up the staircase. Go no further than floor 3, and hand the guard this badge to be let in.&quot;</p> <p>The receptionist gave Max and Alex two visitor badges, one for each of them. They both nodded, heading for the doorway with the metal detectors and beginning to make their way to Bill's room. They made sure to leave their bags with the receptionist, since weapons were not allowed in the building. They walked up the staircase of the huge skyscraper until they reached floor 3, which was guarded by an M.E.G. operative.</p> <p>&quot;Please display your passes and reason of visiting.&quot; the guard ordered.</p> <p>&quot;We're here to visit Base Leader Bill. He summoned us to his office.&quot; Alex responded.</p> <p>The guard nodded, letting them into the hallway. &quot;Good luck.&quot; He chuckled. They walked down the hallway of the offices of all the Base Leaders. Base Leaders were nothing special: The only thing that separated them from a regular M.E.G. member was their ability to boss said members around within the divisions of levels that they commanded. After reaching the office labelled Base Leader Bill Reddinson, they paused in front of the door, knocking on it and waiting for a reply.</p> <p>&quot;Who's thewe?&quot; A high pitched voice called from the other side of the room.</p> <p>&quot;Alex and Max, we're here because you asked us to come over yesterday.&quot; Alex replied, shouting to make herself heard.</p> <p>&quot;Ahh, Awex and Max, come on in.&quot; said the voice once more. Max walked into a familiar looking office, immediately stepping onto a plush, red carpet. The wallpapers were colored a mahogany brown, and they were adorned with framed pictures of several mementos of the owner's life. Several bookshelves stood poised near the walls, all a meager two shelves long, specifically made for the owner in question: A five year old boy, who was currently standing next to a small filing cabinet, organizing what looked to be highly important documents. He walked towards a large, leather office chair, and climbed onto it with some struggle. With some effort, he reached to the desk, turned on a small fan, and arranged a sign with his name on it in the front of his desk.</p> <p>&quot;Morning Bill. Seems like a busy day, eh?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;Yes, it wooks wike it.&quot; He said, breathing in deeply after the tremendous task of getting onto his chair. &quot;Awight, I have cawwed you two up here for a <em>vewy</em> impowtant task.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What is the 'impowtant task' Bill?&quot; Asked Max, who was holding back tears at this point. Alex lightly elbowed him.</p> <p>&quot;I want you to go to 6.1 and write a fowmal weport on the ten B.N.T.G. twading outposts to make sure they are up to standard, and that no shady deawings are going on.&quot; He ordered. He handed them both clipboards with multiple blank questionnaires on them, along with an attached pen. &quot;Make sure you use pwofessional tone, descwibe it pwoperwy, and use wegible handwiting. I need to be able to wead it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'm surprised you're old enough to read.&quot; Max muttered under his breath.</p> <p>Bill glared at him. &quot;I am 65 years owd, I'm pwetty sure I can wead. Can we pwease not bwing up da 'accident'? Show some wespect to yow supewiors.&quot; Bill ordered. Max nodded, holding back a snicker.</p> <p>&quot;Awight.&quot; Max mocked, purposely mispronouncing his r's and I's.</p> <p>&quot;Can you please take this seriously?&quot; Alex grumbled quietly. Bill glared at him with a resentful gaze in his eye.</p> <p>&quot;Anyways, I won't keep you much wonger. I expect these weports back soon.&quot; Bill commanded. Alex nodded. Bill glared at Max. &quot;This is a sewious assignment. No jokes, no insuwts about my cuwwent &#8212; hopefuwwy tempowary &#8212; appeawance, and no iwwewevant, half-baked weports.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yes sir. I'll make sure he abides by those orders.&quot; she replied, glancing at Max.</p> <p>&quot;Anyways, get to it. I have owganization tasks to take cawe wof.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Promptly, sir.&quot; Alex grabbed Max and lead him out of the office, shutting the door behind her. As soon as they got within a far enough range from Bill's office that they could not be heard, Max let out all the laughter he had been bottling in.</p> <p>&quot;Can you please take things seriously for once? Is it that difficult?&quot; Alex sighed.</p> <p>&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot; Max responded, completely mocking her with a highly exaggerated, serious voice. He gave a salute as a further jest. She rolled her eyes in response and beckoned him forward.</p> <p>After getting their bags and exiting the skyscraper, they proceeded back down the infinite confines of the city. Many different shops, buildings, and group headquarters caught their eyes as they strolled down the streets.</p> <p>&quot;Alex, you really need to lighten up. &quot; Max snickered.</p> <p>&quot;I'll 'lighten up' when you start taking M.E.G. affairs seriously and stop disrespecting the Base Leaders.&quot; Alex responded.</p> <p>&quot;Alex, he literally got turned into a five year old.&quot; Max chuckled. Alex cracked a smile.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, fine. It was a little funny.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Is that, wait, emotion?!&quot; Max taunted. She elbowed him in reply, still smiling.</p> <p>Alex scrolled through her handheld tablet to get directions to the nearest 6.1 entrance point. In the meantime, Max skimmed through the questionnaire reports Bill had given them, staring at the paper with a dull, bored gaze, as if wishing it would just vanish right in front of him.</p> <p>&quot;How much farther is it? I wanna get this crap done quickly so we can go and actually enjoy our day.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;According to my tablet's directions, this restaurant further down the road should lead us straight into Level 6.1.&quot; Alex responded. She looked up from her tablet and pointed towards an Asian-looking restaurant.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, let's get this over with.&quot; Max sighed. The two entered the restaurant, immediately passing through the floor into Level 6.1. They fell through the ceiling, landing on the hard, concrete floor of Level 6.1 with a thud.</p> <p>&quot;I'm never going to get used to that.&quot; Max muttered, slightly disoriented.</p> <p>&quot;It's weird at first, but eventually you stop getting sick after every clip.&quot; Alex responded. They gazed upon the long, linear hallway of never-ending restaurants, all filled to the brim with wanderers. Several outposts of different people were scattered around, each trying to offer trades for their wares or show adverts to wanderers that roamed the long pathway, with restaurants on one side, and red concrete walls on the other.</p> <p>&quot;I asked if we could get coffee before we dealt with Bill, and we didn't get any whatsoever. We're gonna deal with the B.N.T.G. in a minute, so I <em>definitely</em> need that boost now. Can we actually get some this time?&quot; Max said with a hopeful tone.</p> <p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Alex replied. &quot;Let's just go into one of these restaurants near here. This one sound good to you?&quot; She said, pointing at a small café only a few steps away from them.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, I could care less where we go, I just want coffee.&quot; Max sighed in relief, his stomach roaring like an angry lion. They walked into one of the restaurants labeled &quot;The Scrambled Eggs Café&quot; and seated themselves at a table. A Faceling walked up to them, handing them each a menu and a set of silverware. It pointed at its name tag, which read out 'Griselda FerrdenShmurr'. Max squinted at the name tag, figuring out how to pronounce it, confused why the Facelings always had such strange names.</p> <p>&quot;Morning Griselda!&quot; Max smiled politely. The Faceling grunted happily in reply. It looked down at a small tablet and slowly typed something out.</p> <p>&quot;Hello. It is nice to meet you.&quot; A robotic, text-to-speech voice spoke out of the tablet. Max smiled at the scene, in awe at how cool it all seemed. The Faceling walked back to the kitchen as the two scoured the menus.</p> <p>&quot;Once we're done, we get straight back to work.&quot; Alex reminded him.</p> <p>&quot;I know.&quot; Max replied. &quot;Let's not worry about that for now. So what are you having?&quot;</p> <hr /> <p><em>A faint sound could be heard from far down the long hallway of Level 6.1. It sounded like a distressed scream, as if an animal was being killed, but with a hint of anger.</em></p> <p><em>Two B.N.T.G. members stood at one of their trading outposts, quieting down upon hearing their screams. &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; said one of them to the other. &quot;You're hearing that right?&quot; The other shrugged at their companion. They kept listening for a while, the screaming continuously getting louder, until the one that spoke decided he'd investigate the source of the noise.</em></p> <p><em>He stepped away from his station, and onto the long pathway of Level 6.1. Far down the path, the source of the noise could be made out, and it was approaching fast. His eyes widened when he realized the thing that was screaming wasn't a thing, but rather, a person.</em></p> <p><em>He turned to his companion. &quot;Mike, hand me the crossbow, we've got a situation.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>Mike bent down, obeying the order, picking up the crossbow, and passing it to his friend. &quot;Dude, what is that thing?&quot;</em></p> <p><em>The other agent, Terry, looked at the person running towards them, who was getting closer by the second. &quot;I don't know what that thing is, but I've got a bad feeling about this&#8230;&quot;</em></p> <p><em>As the figure got closer, he saw that it was a woman. She had black, waist-long hair, with parts of it dyed with light blue streaks. She donned a grey sweater, and an equally grey pair of sweatpants, with white sneakers standing in contrast with her clothes. Perhaps the most peculiar thing about her was a dark, inky substance that was coming out of her mouth like a faucet. She carried a small pouch with her, which seemed to be full of various loose objects.</em></p> <p><em>As she got within shooting distance, Terry steadied his crossbow, and shouted out a command.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;Excuse me lady,&quot; He boomed loudly and sternly, &quot;I'm going to have to ask you to stop right there!&quot;</em></p> <p><em>The woman, still screaming like at the top of her lungs, ignored him, continuing her sprint towards the area. As she got closer, she reached into her bag and pulled out a small red crystal, tossing it towards the duo. As soon as it made contact with the ground, it exploded, blasting them both into the air. Terry hit the ground hard, his vision blurry as he struggled to get up. He looked one last time at the screaming woman as she continued her mad dash across the level, and then he blacked out.</em></p> <hr /> <p>Max's eating was interrupted by a sudden shockwave from somewhere nearby. He paused his chewing, looking at Alex as if to confirm what he had just heard. He then heard wild, rabid screaming coming from the vicinity.</p> <p>&quot;Is that screaming?&quot; Alex asked him as she also paused her eating, looking up from her food.</p> <p>&quot;Should we&#8230; uh&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, we definitely should.&quot; Alex finished. She got up from her seat and began exiting the restaurant, Max following close behind. She looked towards Griselda's direction, calling out a quick &quot;We'll be back soon!&quot; before heading back out into the main path to investigate. The scene they saw before them was complete and utter bedlam.</p> <p>Several different patrons from various different restaurants ran around, all running away from a wild-looking woman who was assaulting random wanderers with various different weapons. M.E.G. agents surrounded her, each one attempting to shoot her with a standard-issue crossbow, but they were unable to hit her, as she evaded each one of them with inhuman speed.</p> <p>Reaching into the same pouch from which she got the crystal, she pulled out a small, black baton. She then proceeded to press a button on it, which extended it into a long, kendo-stick like weapon, which was almost as tall as her, and required the usage of both hands for her to hold. Blue bolts of electricity seemed to come out from it, their full force demonstrated as she hit an M.E.G. agent who was running towards her. When she whacked him with the stick, he fell to the ground unconscious, part of his hair singed.</p> <p>&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&quot; The woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She turned around, whacking yet another agent unconscious, and hitting him once again when he fell to the ground, burning a sizeable part of his skin. Another nearby agent ran up behind her, firing a taser at her with the hopes of stunning her. Unluckily for him, she managed to thwart the wires with the stick, proceeding to then hit him with it. She then quickly walked over to one of the fallen agents, picking up their crossbow, and firing it at the thigh of yet another agent. This caused them to fall to the ground and yelp in pain, which rendered them immobile.</p> <p>&quot;Woah woah woah woah!&quot; Max called out. &quot;What in the world is going on here?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Stay back, I'll handle this.&quot; Alex ordered, sticking her hand in front of Max. Sinclair fired an arrow at Alex, who proceeded to just narrowly avoid the arrow, the rush created by it blowing a small patch of her hair up. Alex reached into her bag, grabbing a small throwing star. She threw it at the woman, striking her in the arm, which caused the woman to drop her crossbow and yelp in pain, effectively stopping her screaming.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Max called out, ignoring Alex's order. He approached the woman, who bled profusely out of her shoulder. She stared at the ground, her greasy, black hair covering her face. Her breathing was extremely heavy and labored.</p> <p>&quot;How&#8230;&quot; she said through heavy, unrhythmic gasps for breaths. &quot;could you&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Sorry, what did you say?&quot; Max asked again.</p> <p>&quot;HOW COULD YOU?!&quot; the woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She pushed past Alex, knocking her onto the floor, and leapt at Max. The full weight of her body knocked them both to the floor. The woman then put Max in a headlock, and pulled out a small dagger, putting the sharp side against his neck.</p> <p>&quot;Wait! Please!&quot; Alex called out, her eyes widening in desperation. The woman cackled like a crazy person.</p> <p>&quot;Listen here lady. You tell me what you filthy meggies did to our church, and I don't slice up your boyfriend's neck!&quot; She threatened, with a heavy amount of lunacy in her voice. Her greasy, black hair covered half of her face, the uncovered part showing the crazy woman's bloodlusted face in full-view.</p> <p>&quot;What are you talking about lady? We didn't do anything! And he is not my boyfriend!&quot; Alex yelled, raising her voice.</p> <p>&quot;TELL ME!&quot; The woman screamed at the top of her lungs. She poked the tip of the blade into Max's neck, causing a tiny drop of blood to pour out.</p> <p>&quot;Wait! Please!&quot; Alex cried.</p> <p>&quot;You have ten seconds before I carve him up like a Thanksgiving turkey!&quot; The woman growled.</p> <p>&quot;Please! We didn't do anything to you!&quot; Alex screamed with desperation in her voice.</p> <p>&quot;Ten!&quot; She snarled.</p> <p>&quot;Lady! We didn't do anything!&quot; Max yelled angrily. He attempted to elbow her in the stomach, but it did nothing.</p> <p>&quot;Nine!&quot; She screamed. Max kept struggling. Alex looked around, not sure what to do.</p> <p>&quot;Eight!&quot; She yelled, her voice getting louder and crazier as the count got lower.</p> <p>&quot;Screw you lady!&quot; Max exclaimed, struggling for his life, unable to break free.</p> <p>&quot;I'm bored, let's skip to the good part! ONE!&quot; She howled.</p> <p>&quot;NO!&quot; Alex screamed. The woman lifted her knife to pierce Max's neck, screaming with rage. She thrust her blade towards his neck, stopping abruptly a few inches away from it. She loosened her grip on Max, who got out of her loosening headlock, quickly crawling towards Alex. The woman reached behind her and pulled a small dart out of her arm.</p> <p>&quot;Aw come o&#8212;&quot; The woman mumbled before collapsing to the floor unconscious. Alex watched as the agent who threw the dart approached the woman from behind.</p> <p>&quot;Tranquilizer darts, aren't they wonderful?&quot; The agent snickered, laughing at his own joke. Max and Alex sighed in relief. They looked at the unconscious woman, black ink still oozing from her mouth.</p> <p>Max turned towards Alex with a wry smile. &quot;So you do care about me, huh?&quot; he teased.</p> <p>&quot;I told you, I was handling it.&quot; Alex grumbled.</p> <p>&quot;Don't be all serious again, I see you holding back those tears.&quot; Max smiled. Alex cracked a small smile, and then elbowed him in the gut. She let one single tear escape her eyes, relieved that her friend was still alive and kicking. They got off the ground and inspected the woman.</p> <p>&quot;Who the heck is this lady anyways? What was she on about?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair Beckett; the most infamous Follower of Jerry.&quot; The agent responded.</p> <p>&quot;<em>This</em> is Sinclair?&quot; Max asked with a tinge of disappointment in his voice. &quot;I&#8230; kinda expected more to be honest&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'm not sure what she was on about, but she's done stuff like this before. It's usually because she thinks we're responsible for some stuff that happened to their cult, I don't know. Anyways, I've got a med team coming from Level 11 to treat all the injured people. She nastied them up real good.&quot; The agent sighed.</p> <p>&quot;Max and I will deal with Sinclair. You go help the med team.&quot; Alex replied. The agent nodded, and went to go wake up the victims of the attack.</p> <p>&quot;I'll go ask for some take-out boxes.&quot; Max added, walking back into the restaurant.</p> <hr /> <p>Sinclair woke up in a dark room on a cold, metal chair. She attempted to stand up, but her arms were held down by metal cuffs. She started shaking violently, attempting to free herself of her restraints.</p> <p>&quot;Finally awake, huh?&quot; Max said, somewhat condescendingly, sitting next to Alex on the other side of the dimly lit room. Sinclair calmed her struggling and glared at him.</p> <p>&quot;What happened to our little agreement?&quot; Sinclair snarled, ink drooling from her mouth. Her long, messy hair covered half her face, alleviating Max from seeing the other half of her face, which had a hateful look plastered on it. &quot;You don't bother us, and we don't bother you.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Hypocrite! You came out of nowhere and assaulted multiple agents, causing a complete scene on 6.1!&quot; Alex replied. He moved towards a pile of papers he had sitting on the table, picked them up, and began reading them out to her.</p> <p>&quot;Two B.N.T.G. agents have severe second degree burns, and one of them has a broken vertebrate. Nine M.E.G. agents have gotten blunt force trauma to their heads, and small burns from the electricity of the taser stick you assaulted them with. Another agent has a bad crossbow wound in their thigh, and the doctors aren't sure if she'll walk without a limp for the rest of her life. Four other agents are currently undergoing the effects of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-48">Liquid Pain</a> due to those little needles you were throwing at them. Then, you almost killed me! These are serious allegations, some of these guys will be in the hospital for months, and the liquid pain victims will probably have to be euthanized! Are you aware of the weight of these atrocities?!&quot; Max ranted. Sinclair chuckled, a slight hint of lunacy in her voice.</p> <p>&quot;You're lucky I couldn't do any more. After what you scumbag meggies did to our chur&#8212;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What are you on about?! We did nothing of the sort to any church!&quot; Max exclaimed, slamming his hand on the table.</p> <p>&quot;LIAR!&quot; Sinclair screamed, shaking violently in the chair, slamming her head against the back of the seat. After she ceased the gyrations, she stared at Max with inhuman rage in her eyes. &quot;I walked back into our home, our place of worship, to see the end of it completely enveloped in black void. What did you do?&quot; Sinclair asked through clenched teeth.</p> <p>&quot;Are you talking about <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-274">Jerry's Room</a>?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;Is that what you people call it? What an original name.&quot; Sinclair snarled sarcastically.</p> <p>&quot;Wait&#8230; You're saying Jerry's room is being consumed by some sort of black void?&quot; Alex asked, her eyes widened slightly.</p> <p>&quot;Oh! So you figured it out!&quot; Sinclair snarked with an overly peppy voice. Alex opened her mouth as if to say something, but she closed it again, opting to remain silent for the time being.</p> <p>&quot;That's not good.&quot; Alex whispered under her breath. &quot;Give me a minute, I gotta go make some calls.&quot; Alex stood up from her chair and pulled out a small cell phone from her bag. Before she exited the room completely, Max heard her dial up Bill, telling him that they'd have to postpone the report for a while. Then she closed the door, leaving just him and Sinclair alone in the same room.</p> <p>Max stared at Sinclair, and she stared back at him, ink still oozing out of her mouth. He said nothing for as long as they maintained eye contact, but as he observed her, he couldn't help but feel slightly disgusted at the scene before him.</p> <p>&quot;Why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer.&quot; She remarked aggressively. Max didn't respond to her taunt.</p> <p>A minute or two later, Alex walked back in. &quot;Alright, I told Bill that Sinclair came and attacked a bunch of people, and that we need to bring her back to Jerry's room. I didn't talk about the void thing, because I don't want the overseers sticking their noses into this. We're just going to go figure out what the heck is going on, and see if there's any way to stop it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Wait, so we're going to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a>?&quot; Max asked.</p> <p>&quot;You got it. Pack your things, we're leaving as soon as the other agents arr- wait, nevermind, here they are, I guess.&quot; She said as three other agents walked into the room. &quot;That was quick.&quot; She exclaimed.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, uh, what about Coocoo for Cocoa Puffs over there, is she coming with us?&quot; One of the agents muttered.</p> <p>&quot;We've confiscated her bag of weapons so she doesn't pull anything funny. If she does, we can just stun her with a taser so she doesn't knock us all out again.&quot; Alex replied, glaring at Sinclair.</p> <p>She approached Sinclair and looked down at her. &quot;You try anything, and you get zapped out of your life.&quot; She threatened, showing off her taser. Alex bent down next to her handcuffs, releasing Sinclair from the restraints, freeing her from her imprisonment.</p> <p>&quot;Fine, I'll behave, but only because I want to know what's going on.&quot; She growled, standing up.</p> <p>&quot;I really do not want to go back to Level 0. The smell there is <em>disgusting</em>.&quot; Max complained.</p> <p>&quot;Trust me, Level 0 is much better than a place like Level 5 or 7.&quot; Alex replied.</p> <p>&quot;Why do you stupid meggies use numbers for levels? That's so weird. Just call it the Terror Hotel, or Thalassophobia.&quot; Sinclair scoffed condescendingly.</p> <p>&quot;It sounds more official to use the numbers. Now come on, we have lots of walking to do.&quot; Alex replied. &quot;There's a room here that usually brings you to Level 0 if you successfully clip through the wall. We just have to all go through at the same time so we don't get separated.&quot;</p> <p>The group of agents and Sinclair walked down a hallway of the large skyscraper, Alex leading the way. She peeked inside each room, looking for the entrance, whilst Sinclair walked next to Max, who had an angry vengeful look pointed towards him for the whole trip. After a few minutes, a faint buzzing noise could be heard down the hallway. They followed the noise until they finally made it to a room where the noise was much louder compared to the other rooms they'd been to.</p> <p>&quot;Is this it?&quot; Max asked.</p> <p>&quot;Looks like it.&quot; Alex replied looking into the room. It was a dimly lit office room with no furniture inside of it, save for a singular, sad, buzzing fluorescent light, which buzzed much louder than it usually would.</p> <p>&quot;That stupid buzzing, I hate it.&quot; Max sighed, dreading the hours in its midst that he would soon have to endure.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, listen. We need to perform a controlled clip into Level 0 in a very strategic way so that we don't get separated millions of miles apart. If we all hold hands and successfully pass through the wall, we should hopefully all end up in the same place. Ready?&quot; Alex asked.</p> <p>&quot;As much as I possibly can be knowing what awaits me, yeah.&quot; Max sighed. The whole crew grabbed hands, Sinclair included, as they prepared to pass through the wall. Alex pressed it with her hand a few times, before bumping her body into it. She repeated this a few times until her hand phased through the wall. She thrust her body into it, passing through it precisely as to not break the clip, all of them following suit behind in the same fashion as Alex.</p> <p>For a while, it was entirely pitch black around Max. He felt as if he was floating through an empty void, his only connection to the world being the hands he was holding. The whole experience was extremely nauseating. Thankfully, it did not last long, as they quickly found themselves falling onto the nasty, damp carpets of Level 0. The noise of buzzing fluorescent lights overpowered any other sound in the whole place.</p> <p>&quot;Well, here we are. Good ol' Level 0.&quot; Max sighed.</p> <p>&quot;Cut it meggie, I live here!.&quot; Sinclair snarked. &quot;Now stop all your stuffy commanding and ordering around, and let <em>me</em> lead the way. I know this place like the back of my hand.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;How is that even possible? All the rooms are identical!&quot; Alex asked as they began to walk.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not talking about the layout, I'm talking about how to work this place. Watch and learn, princess.&quot; Sinclair taunted. She looked around the room, taking in the scene before her: The rotted yellow wallpaper, the disgusting carpet, and the overwhelming buzzing sound. She beckoned the group forward as she gazed around the room.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Alex asked impatiently.</p> <p>&quot;Shut it.&quot; Sinclair replied. She looked to her right. &quot;Over here.&quot; She pointed at the wall. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first, until she pointed out a subtle difference from the other parts of the walls. &quot;Slightly darker shade of yellow, carpet isn't nearly as wet. I wouldn't expect you to know about these things.&quot; Sinclair remarked, receiving a glare from Alex in return. Sinclair walked through the wall with ease, before sticking her head back though. &quot;Coming?&quot;</p> <p>Alex sighed and passed through the wall, the others following behind. They proceeded to walk through room after room for a few hours, clipping through walls here and there to get to the fabled room of Jerry. After many long hours of repetitive rooms, they finally stumbled across a normal looking door, which was very out of place for Level 0.</p> <p>&quot;How did you find that in only a few hours? This would take regular people years to find!&quot; Max exclaimed shockingly.</p> <p>&quot;I've been here for a while. You learn to figure things out.&quot; Sinclair replied. They stared at the door, which was very basic looking, even when compared to other doors in The Backrooms. Sinclair opened the door, which lead into a large lounge with couches, desks, dining rooms, and pictures of a blue parrot all around the room. A group of people relaxed on a number of the couches, each one in clad blue robes with golden markings on them.</p> <p>&quot;Sinclair! Why are you bringing lost ones into our church?&quot; one of them exclaimed.</p> <p>&quot;Relax, they're here to check out the void. After some&#8230; forced negotiation, they came with me to inspect the area.&quot; Sinclair replied. She walked over to one of the minifridges and pulled out a small vial of black ink, consuming its contents immediately. The rest of the crew looked at her in disgust.</p> <p>&quot;Do you mind&#8230; uh&#8230; leading us to the 'void' thing?&quot; Max asked. Sinclair licked her lips, completely ignoring Max as she called out to the other members.</p> <p>&quot;Yo Macy! You got someone who wants to see you!&quot; Sinclair screamed down the corner of the wall. Max's heart dropped at the name.</p> <p>&quot;Wait&#8230;&quot; He whispered to himself. &quot;If that's who I think it is&#8230;&quot; Three people stepped from around the corner. One was a man, his lower face masked by what looked like a plastic bird beak. His skin was entirely covered by a slightly ridiculous looking bird costume, which seemed to give his skin a blue tinge. Max couldn't verify that his skin was <em>actually</em> blue however, as most of it was covered by said costume. The second wore a robe similar to her other members, but it was colored a dazzling gold instead of blue. She was short, her face covered entirely by the hood. On the golden robed individual sat a blue bird &#8212; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7">Jerry</a> himself.</p> <p>&quot;Who did you bring this time, Sinclair?&quot; Jerry squawked, to the surprise of Max and Alex. He sounded like a typical parrot, but the fact that he could string together whole sentences was slightly shocking.</p> <p>&quot;Meggies&#8230;&quot; The masked man scoffed in disgust, looking at the group.</p> <p>The golden-robed person was trembling. &quot;Wait&#8230;&quot; She whispered. She lowered her hood to reveal a short-haired, chubby cheeked woman. She was flabbergasted, seeming to be in utter shock and awe at the scene that stood before her. &quot;Max?&quot;</p> <p>Max's heart dropped as he realized who it was.
