&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-indent:20px&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded as proof that he understood. Even his movements were also full of enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the truth was that he only partially understood. To him, some of the customs sounded strange and unreasonable, but he couldn&#039;t just argue his opinion in front of the locals, could he? He nodded and accepted all the information given to him even though he felt odd in his mind. Well, it&#039;s called culture. Some things might be strange and abnormal to him, so he should just accept it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local representative&#039;s explanation then moved on to the theme of local folklore, a story that would tell a bit about the customary rules. Maybe it&#039;s time to hear the reason behind all those rules. Hey, rules wouldn&#039;t exist if there wasn&#039;t something wrong going on, right? The folklore talks about the forest that has been a part of their lives since the beginning of their village—ever since they arrived in this strange world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-Faced Forest, as the name implies, is a forest that is originally two-faced. Yes, why is it called two-faced? What does that mean? While those questions were swirling around in his head, the representative somehow managed to come up with the answer he needed. Two-Faced Forest, a forest that has a very different side if you are not careful in your actions. That side is not something you can take lightly, that side is something that should never be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the locals here are very reluctant for anyone to see the other side of the forest they live in. Who knows what that other side looks like since no one is allowed to see it? It is said to be filled with death and the end of the forest. It is said to be beyond the world we understand and recognize. It is said to be the opposite and negative version of everything. Hm, sounds interesting, doesn&#039;t it? The locals forbid anyone from visiting the place because they say there is an evil figure guarding the place. Some say it&#039;s like a hell with an executioner inside. Who knows? It feels like they&#039;re exaggerating something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the truth behind the story is, because there is no mention of how to access the other side of the forest. Hm, a location whose position is reversed from the current location—is it underground? Did that mean there was a forest under the soles of his feet? He then thought about how to find the path without being noticed by the locals, let&#039;s just say that his actions were to prove that there was indeed something under his feet. Maybe at night, or maybe after the meeting was over? Either way, he need to monitor the situation first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the representative finished with their story and left him alone in his room, he then tried to recall what he knew so far. The Two-Faced Forest was called like that because there were two different sides to the forest, however, there was no mention of a way to find access to the other side. The other side of the forest is a different version of the forest, which is the opposite of the forest appearance that people know. The more he thought about it, the more curious he became. He then read the list of customary rules, the list of rules seemed strange to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some rules that stated if he violated then he would be expelled from the forest. Was this a way to get to the other side of the forest? Hm, it&#039;s useless to think about it, how about we just try it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! Does he really have to do it? What if that place really was hell? What if he can&#039;t go back? There was no mention of how to get out of there, not even detailed information about the place! He squirmed on his bed, on one hand he was curious, and on the other hand he was scared. It seemed like his two logics were fighting each other, and it made him roll around on his bed like a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he fell off the bed due to his carelessness, but it hurt like hell because the top of his head landed first on the hard floor. He held his head while groaning in pain, and when he started to get up and open his eyes, he immediately realized something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Faced Forest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-Faced Forest&lt;/strong&gt; is a tropical rainforest area of unknown size. This rainforest is filled with Earth — typical flora and fauna with a fairly dense density of trees-there are also open areas although rarely found, the temperature is very cool and humid enough that a thick fog covers this forest area. Entering the forest with thick, waterproof clothing is recommended as the forest is quite wet. The soil conditions are very fertile and the landscape tends to be flat with fairly sparse hilly areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small lakes and streams can be found in the forest which can be a source of drinking water for the Survivors—the water must be boiled first. The forest is filled with many plants and animals that can be utilised as a source of food and survival materials. Survivors should be careful of the fog that can block their field of vision as compasses have been found not to work here, so navigation should be paused or Survivors will become stray further into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level has a day and night cycle although the duration is never fixed, so Survivors who have never been to this level before may be bothered by this. The sky in the level is not much different from the sky on Earth in both day and night-the existence of celestial bodies also exists in the sky along with weather events that can occur randomly. However, the exchange of day and night occurs abruptly without any morning and evening phases. In addition, Survivors should establish a hiding place as soon as possible before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, hostile entities will become more frequent to discover and may harm Survivors who do not hide well. Therefore, Survivors should quickly build a hiding place out of whatever they encounter as well as gather nutritional supplies before nightfall. This forest is filled with many non-earthly entities when night falls, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8&quot;&gt;Hound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-5&quot;&gt;Clump&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10&quot;&gt;Skin Stealer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entitas-4-id&quot;&gt;Mudman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entitas-5-id&quot;&gt;Big Jaw&lt;/a&gt;, and so on. All of these entities will disappear when daylight comes and will be replaced by passive entities and normal faunas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-center&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t4tDLPL.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:100%; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boat discovery at night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level conditions that are safe from non-euclidean terrain disturbances make exploration safe and even mappable, however, going too deep into the forest can usually lead to a loss of direction due to the density of the vegetation. The forest landscape does not always look like a typical forest, the deeper into the forest the more oddities Survivors will encounter. Survivors will most likely encounter remnants of Earth-style human civilisation such as ruins of buildings, vehicles that have been destroyed, and other objects that are only made by humans. It is not known where they came from because they will be found suddenly—which was not there before. Surprisingly, they will appear at night and their existence will always be related to the personal life of the Survivor who finds them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nighttime phenomenon that can be encountered by Survivors is hallucinations caused by fog, these hallucinations will make Survivors see a person&#039;s figure or hear a familiar voice from a distance. The voices that can be heard are usually in the form of a calling or the sound of music that is quite quiet but echoing. This phenomenon is basically harmless if the Survivor does not try to approach it because it will usually lead to death due to the high number of entities in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bases, Outposts and Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Silvania Community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a community of Survivors in an area called “Silvania” which is located under a &lt;em&gt;giant sky-penetrating tree&lt;/em&gt;. This area is a settlement that spreads from the basin area under the tree to the base of the giant tree. This farming and hunting community is welcoming to newcomers; they accept exchanges of goods, requests for resource assistance, or becoming new residents of their territory. Arriving here is a top priority if you want to survive longer in the forest, however, Survivors must follow their customs if they want to stay with them. Violations will usually lead to expulsion, but Survivors can still be readmitted as long as they follow certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these customs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-Faced Forest has its own natural laws. If you start to doubt the nature of Two-Faced Forest, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the various oddities in the forest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Do not let your head be at the bottom while your feet are at the top. If you want to do that, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Unknown meaning)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#039;t let your friend come with you. If you must bring them with you, then stay 5 &lt;em&gt;depa&lt;/em&gt; (5 Fathom, ±10 metres) away. If you or one of you feels afraid, leave the Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the advice to form a small hiding place at night, a large hiding place will attract the attention of entities.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter someone who can speak, they are trustworthy. Encountering someone who is silent or a shadow that can speak, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the phenomenon of hallucinations at night)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you remember all these warnings, use them. You will realise yourself when to use them, but if not, leave the Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the instinct that will arise on its own)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-Faced Forest will not help you if you break all their rules, if you break them, you are no longer in Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the punishment of expulsion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;As the name implies, Two-Faced Forest has two faces. If you see both faces, then you are no longer in Two-Faced Forest. (Unknown meaning)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entrances and Exits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entrances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering the dense bushes between the trees can bring Survivors to this level although it is rare. However, the shrubbery in the &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-8-id&quot;&gt;Death Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-14-id&quot;&gt;Land of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-23-id&quot;&gt;Megamendung&lt;/a&gt; areas have a higher probability of taking Survivors to this level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This level can be accessed with certainty in levels that can connect to multiple levels such as &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-15-id&quot;&gt;Saneless Show&lt;/a&gt; (a television showing a forest area) and &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-27-id&quot;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; (a door with shrubs around it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask Silvania for help to show you the way out to another safe level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering the ruins of buildings can lead Survivors to other levels such as &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-37-id&quot;&gt;a market that has been closed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-41-id&quot;&gt;a level that still under construction&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-43-id&quot;&gt;Pagaria&lt;/a&gt; area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering cave openings is not recommended as it will usually lead Survivors into the &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-44-id&quot;&gt;tripophobia inducing cave&lt;/a&gt; region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to walk in the fog with strong winds will take Survivors into &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-46-id&quot;&gt;The Great Storm&lt;/a&gt; region, if the fog suddenly turns more suffocating then the Survivor will arrive at the &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-48-id&quot;&gt;Ashes to Ashes&lt;/a&gt; region if they keep entering the fog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This rainforest is filled with Earth — typical flora and fauna with a fairly dense density of trees-there are also open areas although rarely found, the temperature is very cool and humid enough that a thick fog covers this forest area. Entering the forest with thick, waterproof clothing is recommended as the forest is quite wet. The soil conditions are very fertile and the landscape tends to be flat with fairly sparse hilly areas.</p> <p>Small lakes and streams can be found in the forest which can be a source of drinking water for the Survivors—the water must be boiled first. The forest is filled with many plants and animals that can be utilised as a source of food and survival materials. Survivors should be careful of the fog that can block their field of vision as compasses have been found not to work here, so navigation should be paused or Survivors will become stray further into the forest.</p> <p>This level has a day and night cycle although the duration is never fixed, so Survivors who have never been to this level before may be bothered by this. The sky in the level is not much different from the sky on Earth in both day and night-the existence of celestial bodies also exists in the sky along with weather events that can occur randomly. However, the exchange of day and night occurs abruptly without any morning and evening phases. In addition, Survivors should establish a hiding place as soon as possible before nightfall.</p> <p>At night, hostile entities will become more frequent to discover and may harm Survivors who do not hide well. Therefore, Survivors should quickly build a hiding place out of whatever they encounter as well as gather nutritional supplies before nightfall. This forest is filled with many non-earthly entities when night falls, such as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8">Hound</a>, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-5">Clump</a>, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10">Skin Stealer</a>, <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entitas-4-id">Mudman</a>, <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entitas-5-id">Big Jaw</a>, and so on. All of these entities will disappear when daylight comes and will be replaced by passive entities and normal faunas.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t4tDLPL.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:100%; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Boat discovery at night</p> </div> </div> <p>The level conditions that are safe from non-euclidean terrain disturbances make exploration safe and even mappable, however, going too deep into the forest can usually lead to a loss of direction due to the density of the vegetation. The forest landscape does not always look like a typical forest, the deeper into the forest the more oddities Survivors will encounter. Survivors will most likely encounter remnants of Earth-style human civilisation such as ruins of buildings, vehicles that have been destroyed, and other objects that are only made by humans. It is not known where they came from because they will be found suddenly—which was not there before. Surprisingly, they will appear at night and their existence will always be related to the personal life of the Survivor who finds them.</p> <p>Another nighttime phenomenon that can be encountered by Survivors is hallucinations caused by fog, these hallucinations will make Survivors see a person's figure or hear a familiar voice from a distance. The voices that can be heard are usually in the form of a calling or the sound of music that is quite quiet but echoing. This phenomenon is basically harmless if the Survivor does not try to approach it because it will usually lead to death due to the high number of entities in the forest.</p> <h1><span><strong>Bases, Outposts and Communities</strong></span></h1> <h3><span>Silvania Community</span></h3> <p>There is a community of Survivors in an area called “Silvania” which is located under a <em>giant sky-penetrating tree</em>. This area is a settlement that spreads from the basin area under the tree to the base of the giant tree. This farming and hunting community is welcoming to newcomers; they accept exchanges of goods, requests for resource assistance, or becoming new residents of their territory. Arriving here is a top priority if you want to survive longer in the forest, however, Survivors must follow their customs if they want to stay with them. Violations will usually lead to expulsion, but Survivors can still be readmitted as long as they follow certain conditions.</p> <p>Some of these customs include:</p> <ul> <li>Two-Faced Forest has its own natural laws. If you start to doubt the nature of Two-Faced Forest, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the various oddities in the forest)</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not let your head be at the bottom while your feet are at the top. If you want to do that, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Unknown meaning)</span></li> <li>Don't let your friend come with you. If you must bring them with you, then stay 5 <em>depa</em> (5 Fathom, ±10 metres) away. If you or one of you feels afraid, leave the Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the advice to form a small hiding place at night, a large hiding place will attract the attention of entities.)</li> <li>If you encounter someone who can speak, they are trustworthy. Encountering someone who is silent or a shadow that can speak, leave Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the phenomenon of hallucinations at night)</li> </ul> <p>[33 other lines not included]</p> <ul> <li>If you remember all these warnings, use them. You will realise yourself when to use them, but if not, leave the Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the instinct that will arise on its own)</li> <li>Two-Faced Forest will not help you if you break all their rules, if you break them, you are no longer in Two-Faced Forest. (Referring to the punishment of expulsion)</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As the name implies, Two-Faced Forest has two faces.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-150&lt;/strong&gt; has the appearance of a European-style apartment room with a size of about 4x6 meters that repeats the three directions of the three-dimensional axis (front-back, top-bottom, and left-right) infinitely so that the survivor will only find the same room along their journey. All of these rooms are interconnected by an access point located on each side of the room, this point is in the form of doors and stairs that can be accessed easily. However, survivors cannot return to the previous room after going to a new room through the same access point, they must take a detour first if they want to return to the previous room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each room that experiences this repetition is basically the same in terms of appearance and furniture, but survivors will realize that there are variations in each room they visit. These variations can be in the form of changes in the position of objects, changes in color, the presence/completeness of an object, and so on. Initially these variations are not too obvious to notice, but the further the survivor explores the more obvious these variations will become until eventually the room becomes much different from the first room the survivor encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resources that can be found within each room include food and drink sources, active electronics, clothing, and other basic necessities. These resources can be depleted due to usage so survivors must be able to manage their usage well if they want to survive longer in the level. Additionally, it is possible that survivors will not find any resources in a room, presumably because another survivor has been in the room recently. The resources in the room are known to reappear on their own, but it is unknown how long it will take for them to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arrow marker pointing towards the front, back, left, right, top, and bottom of the room can be found in the center of the room. This marker is known to have been left by a survivor and is intended as a directional aid to survivors who have just entered this level, a stack of documents can also be found underneath the marker as an initial source of information. Each survivor is known to be able to meet up with other survivors although the likelihood of meeting each other is quite small, this is because each survivor has spread out deep within the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive and Negative Areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repetition of rooms basically extends in all directions but the survivors use the three names of the three-dimensional axes of X, Y, and Z for ease of navigation. There are different themes of room variations depending on which direction the survivor goes from the first room where the survivor first set foot in this level. Going towards the front, right and top of the first room is considered as “entering positive region”. Going towards the back, left and bottom of the first room will be considered as “entering negative region”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive Region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, survivors choose to go to this region because it tends to be safer to explore, besides that the variations contained in each room in this region are not too significant, giving the impression of “entering the same room again and again”. The existence of resources is also the same in each room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Negative Region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region has entities in it and will become more dangerous the further into the negative region you go &amp;#8212; the number of entities will increase the further the survivors venture. However, there are more resources in this region than in the positive region. However, the quality of the resources found will deteriorate if you go too deep in this region. Unlike in the positive region, survivors will find that there will be changes to the conditions in the room if they venture deep enough in the negative region. These changes include visible damage to furniture and surfaces, and even leaks and the presence of moss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information: Warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RhhQOCm.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A-150 Label&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level is very difficult to find due to its entrance that can appear in any level at any door&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-609268-1&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If survivors encounter it, never enter this level because those who have entered will not be able to get out again! However, verbal, radio, or online communication is still possible as long as the door is left open&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-609268-2&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Even if the door is left open, survivors cannot exit the level because there is an invisible barrier that will prevent survivors from exiting, unfortunately there is still no way to destroy this barrier. When the door closes and a survivor has entered the level, the “A-150” label attached to the door will detach and fall through the floor. The door will then return to normal (no longer delivering survivors to this level) and the label will randomly reappear elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown how many survivors are trapped in this level, and the fact that they have been randomly scattered within the level makes the chances of meeting up with other survivors very slim. A document left by a survivor in the first room mentions that any survivor who has just entered the level should survive no matter what and find a way out. Also, keep exploring around the border of positive and negative regions such as along the XY, YZ, or ZX lines. This is so that survivors will be in areas that tend to be safe and have slightly more resources. Survivors should also record their coordinate positions on each trip to prevent the risk of accidentally going too deep into negative region, for example: “X1, Y75, Z-3”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bases, Outpost, and Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s no bases, outpost, and communities in this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entrance and Exit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entrance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level can be entered by entering a door with the label “A-150” attached to it, the label can appear randomly on any door in the Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

All of these rooms are interconnected by an access point located on each side of the room, this point is in the form of doors and stairs that can be accessed easily.

&lt;p&gt;The illustration of Lament Room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Lament Room&lt;/strong&gt; is a bathroom measuring approximately 2x2x1.7m with a metal door that cannot be opened. This room has a strong smell of chlorine (other survivors mentioned the smell of ammonia), plus the floor of the room is slightly flooded due to a leaky faucet and a slightly clogged drain, the toilet cannot be used because it is also clogged. There is lighting on the ceiling of the room, but due to its low position, survivors have to be careful not to bump into it. The room has small air vents on the left and right sides of the room, the bathroom walls are made of mossy bricks covered with cement around the door, the iron door is brown in color and has a small window so that survivors can see outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zrY7WZP.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside view of the air vent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view outside the room is known to be similar for every survivor who sees it, all of them showing the view from the location that the survivors miss the most, which is their respective house on Earth. It is unknown whether or not this room is connected to Earth given that the scenes shown are exactly like the survivors&#039; house on Earth, with one survivor even seeing their family members coming out of the house. The situation outside can also change, such as experiencing rain or entering nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging from the position of the viewpoint presented through the window, it can be seen that this room is located inside a building located right in front of the house while another survivor mentioned that the position of this room is across the street because their house on Earth is on the side of the road. However, attempts to communicate were fruitless as whoever outside the room was unaware of the existence of this room &amp;#8212; putting mental pressure on the survivors who were unable to call out to their relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time in the room, voices can be heard from outside which are usually those of the “neighbors” talking about the survivor&#039;s passing and how it has affected the survivor&#039;s family and others. These conversations will continue for hours before finally falling silent. The silence would give way to another conversation but this time from the survivor&#039;s family, usually discussing where the survivor had gone and how much they missed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room is nicknamed the “Lament Room” because it puts “mental pressure” on survivors who enter it by making them regret being in the Backrooms and being separated from their families. Those who enter the room claim this mental stress is enough to drive someone to suicide by touching the electricity in the lights and allowing themselves to be electrocuted &amp;#8212; although there is no evidence of any deaths in this room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entrance and Exit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far there are only three testimonies that tell about this room so the existence of this room is quite doubtful, it is mentioned that the three of them both found this place when they were about to enter the bathroom so it is assumed that this is the only way to enter the room. The three people were only able to get out of the room after hours of being inside, they both experienced a noclip through the floor and arrived at the last level they were on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

						 <div class="snowflakes"> <div class="snowflake"> <p><span style="font-size:100%;">♥️</span><br /></p> </div> <div class="snowflake"> <p>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ<span style="font-size:120%;">💕</span><br /></p> </div> <div class="snowflake"> <p>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ<span style="font-size:80%;">♥️</span><br /></p> </div> </div> <div style="text-align: justify;"> <blockquote> <p>It was on the evening, when February 14th showed 14 wonders to this disastrous world with a bouquet of exquisite flowers beside a charming bottle of almond water, resting on a beautifully adorned table, accompanied by a small candle that illuminated the day in a place where night always lingered. Without missing a beat, the waiter took up his violin and stood beside the table.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The first wonder, a captivating girl with glossy black eyes like the night sky, sitting at that table. She gazed ahead with a sweet smile that had long gone from her face. Her beautiful blue dress, has now nearly became impossible to find elsewhere. How could there be such a stunning girl in this world? This was the first wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The second wonder, a handsome, muscular man seated across from the girl. His gaze was also fixed ahead, accompanied by a smile that revealed his shining white teeth. The dark black tuxedo he wore seemed to absorb the light around him. With both arms elegantly covered in soft white gloves, he held the girl’s hand. How could there be such a considerate man for a girl in this world? This was the second wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The third wonder, a simple, ordinary restaurant waiter attending to the man and the girl. He greeted them with warmth and kindness that felt so familiar, as if reuniting with an old friend. He brought a sense of warmth, acting as a complement to the situation; a silent witness to their meeting that evening. How could there be someone so calm and gracious at serving others in this world? This was the third wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The fourth wonder, a violin that produces romantic melodies with its four strings. A waiter held the bow and played with unwavering confidence. The notes released deep feelings of longing and love into the air that no man could resist. How could there still be a violin left in this world? This was the fourth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The fifth wonder, a bouquet of five stems with each crown adorned in a different hue. The flowers continued to blossom beautifully, capturing every gaze in the vicinity. These flowers could only be found in special places, so precious that even to behold them was a luxury. Their fragrant aroma shifted the air around them into a cool and calming breeze. How could flowers continue to thrive in this world? This was the fifth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The sixth wonder, a small candle that stands steadfast between the man and the girl. A tiny flame flickered on its wick, providing warmth in the air. The candle strove to resist its fate of fading away; it longed to witness their love story unfold to the very end and warming them both with its light. How could there still be a candle alive to witness the journey of a tale within this world? This was the sixth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The seventh wonder, the light emanating from the candle that allows them both to see each other's faces clearly. This glow was a testament to the brightness of their future, where together they would create a new light of their own. How could such illumination endure in this darkened world? This was the seventh wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The eighth wonder, a bottle of almond water, tied with a delicate ribbon. Its contents complemented the warm meal, instantly dissolving any awkwardness in the air. The invigorating taste stung the tongue, banishing all hints of drowsiness. A truly remarkable creation of the restaurant that could someday become a menu item. How could almond water be so delightful? This was the eighth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The ninth wonder, a kalasan roasted chicken displayed before the man and the girl. Its skin gleamed seductively as it reflects the light around it. Devouring it would take a long time, perfectly suited for the long conversation that awaited them. How could such a beautiful roasted chicken still exist in this world? This was the ninth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The tenth wonder, a heart-shaped necklace emerging from the right pocket of the man's trousers. He held both sides of the necklace and began to move it toward the back of the girl's neck. A blush crept onto her sweet face. How could there still be a man who gifts a girl in this world? This was the tenth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The eleventh wonder was a bar of RKB chocolate presented to the girl by a waiter at the end of the evening. Taped to it was a heart-shaped note that read, &quot;<em>Will you marry me?</em>&quot; How could a proposal happen in this world? This was the eleventh wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The twelfth wonder, the girl’s hands started covering the smile on her face, looking back at the man with a bashful expression. She nodded slowly, a gesture signaling her acceptance of the proposal. How could there still be love left in this world? This was the twelfth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The thirteenth wonder, the man started gently taking the girl’s hand, placing a ring he had crafted himself onto her right ring finger. A simple inscription adorned the band that read, &quot;<em>Forever</em>.&quot; How could a ring find its place in this world? This was the thirteenth wonder.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The fourteenth wonder, today is the final miracle. A day so perfect for giving a gift to someone we love. A beautiful day painted in shades of pink, resonating with a sense of romance. Does such a day truly exist? This was the fourteenth wonder, <em>the Valentine’s day</em>.</p> </blockquote> </div> <br /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>The 14 Wonders | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/kehilangan-akan-keajaiban">The Loss of Wonder?</a> &#187;</p> </div> <br /> <div style="text-align: center;"></div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">The&nbsp;Proprietors&nbsp;ⓘ</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;the&nbsp;Proprietors&nbsp;ⓘ</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <div style="text-align: left;"> <p>This article was created in Indonesian by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/marlin-paskalis" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7639664&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="Marlin Paskalis" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7639664)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/marlin-paskalis" >Marlin Paskalis</a></span>;<br /> Translated to English by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/exotichive" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=9462964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="exotichive" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=9462964)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/exotichive" >exotichive</a></span>;</p> <p>Kalasan Theme made by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gyess" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7814406&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="Gyess" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7814406)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gyess" >Gyess</a></span>;<br /> CSS on the snowflakes made by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/draurumy" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7027386&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="DrAurumy" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7027386)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/draurumy" >DrAurumy</a></span>;</p> <p>Revised by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7359971&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="lemme" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7359971)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" >lemme</a></span> and <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gyess" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7814406&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="Gyess" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7814406)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gyess" >Gyess</a></span>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/inspectingcritters" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=9419279&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="InspectingCritters" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=9419279)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/inspectingcritters" >InspectingCritters</a></span></p>

The “rain” ranges from drizzle to thunderstorms but never causes harm to survivors because the “rain” is not real, therefore survivors who are in the area of the phenomenon will still feel dry even though it is raining.</p> <p>This phenomenon can occur anywhere and anytime, regardless of whether it is an open area or an enclosed space, the coverage area is also not too large so it is similar to a local rain, and the duration will usually only last less than an hour. When <strong>Dry Rain</strong> occurs indoors, the water seems to come through the ceiling along with the wind. Whereas if it occurs outdoors, <strong>Dry Rain</strong> will look like it is falling from the sky regardless of whether or not there are clouds in the sky. <strong>Dry Rain</strong> also does not cause flooding because it looks as if all the rainwater is absorbed into the floor even though the floor is very unlikely to absorb water. In addition, this phenomenon will also not wet the survivors or items within its coverage area, uniquely observers will see all objects look wet and even the survivors inside will look soaked. But when the phenomenon ends, everything will return to dry as if there was never any rain.</p> <p>This phenomenon is known to be quite deceptive to new survivors who think there is real rain happening somewhere, and sometimes this phenomenon can also appear at unexpected times and locations, which is known to be quite annoying for survivors. Many survivors state that this illusory phenomenon is more of a nuisance than a threat due to its random nature and the sight is considered quite real, however experienced survivors will not mind <strong>Dry Rain</strong> too much if it suddenly appears above them. In fact, every appearance will usually be taken as a good sign because rain has been considered a blessing from the sky. Those who miss for rain from Earth will also feel grateful that they can still &quot;feel&quot; the rain even if it is fake.</p> <h1><span>Frequency</span></h1> <p><strong>Dry Rain</strong> is known to occur rarely and anywhere randomly, but this phenomenon is noted to only appear in areas where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold and with humidity that is neither too dry nor too humid. It is not known what the exact cause of this phenomenon is due to its random nature so its occurrence cannot be predicted at all.</p> <h1><span>Do's and Don'ts</span></h1> <p>As this phenomenon is not harmful at all, preventive measures are not necessary.</p> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fenomena-26-id">Phenomenon 26-ID</a> | Dry Rain | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fenomena-28-id">All Access</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7359971&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="lemme" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7359971)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" >lemme</a></span></p>

&lt;p&gt;Blue Pump with its additional container tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; is a blue electric water pump that is not much different in appearance from water pumps on Earth. According to the specifications written on its body, this object has a power of 125 watts, weighs about 3 to 4 kilograms with a maximum suction power of 9 meters, can be used for a full 24 hours, and is specialized only for shallow wells making it suitable for daily use. Due to its resemblance to a typical water pump, a “property” test must be performed to distinguish the object from a regular water pump. The object can be used like a normal pump to distribute water, but usually survivors will utilize the unique properties of the object for specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique property &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; will activate if a survivor “asks the object for an order” by attaching a paper with the order name to any part of the object&#039;s body. The “order” can only be a liquid object and the object will convert the water sucked into it into the order ordered by the survivor. Therefore, the object is usually used to convert ordinary water into various types of drinks by survivors so the existence of this object quickly became popular in various survivor colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; is known to be able to convert plain water and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-44&quot;&gt;Cashew Water&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1&quot;&gt;Almond Water&lt;/a&gt; and vice versa, this causes the &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; to become an object that quickly gains “must-have” status for a group of survivors and raises its status as one of the “expensive items” in the Backrooms. The object is also capable of converting whatever it is sucking into other liquid items such as fuel or even chemical items, hence, the object is often used for a variety of things due to its vast ability to produce many types of liquid items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; allegedly gives an “addictive effect” to anyone who drinks the liquids it produces, this report comes from the &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:level-11-id&quot;&gt;Mega Langit Bridge&lt;/a&gt; where some communities of survivors showed aggression in using the object such as fighting over each other and trying to monopolize the use of the object. However, this assumption was later rejected because this “addiction effect” did not appear in communities from other levels that also used the same object. Based on this information, new regulations were then implemented by each community leader in the use of &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt;, these regulations usually vary from community to community but there are similar regulations used such as not using the object for various things but will only be used for important purposes such as local celebrations. The “order” to be placed will be determined after a vote with all members of the community, while the use for things outside of common purposes will be highly restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Discovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally found in every house in &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:level-23-id&quot;&gt;Megamendung&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Blue Pump&lt;/strong&gt; object quickly became the center of attention by many survivors after its properties were discovered and the demand for this object then increased dramatically and made the survivor group who built a small base in the level overwhelmed in welcoming the survivors who continuously arrived at their base. The group then asked the community representatives who came not to carry out massive extractions from within the level, after a long discussion the request was then fulfilled and slowly this object no longer became a targeted object. Now, outside of Megamendung, the object can only be found in sizable and fairly advanced survivor communities in Backrooms. Recent discoveries suggest that the object can also be found in some houses in settlement-themed levels such as &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:level-10-id&quot;&gt;Industrial Village&lt;/a&gt;, but the object in these levels is quite hidden due to the dark conditions of the level or because its position is obstructed from view. This suggests the possibility that this object is actually widely distributed in Backrooms and not only found in Megamendung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning of humanity&#039;s existence in an alien world where nature was so hostile to their existence, these lost settlers were nothing more than a bunch of mosquitoes trapped in an aquarium filled with frogs. No one knew how these frail creatures less than a century old could be dragged away from their home world. Just like that alien world, the original inhabitants disliked or even hated this outsiders. The humans, who were unaccustomed to the pressure from all directions, ended up becoming an easy meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taste? Perhaps it can be seen from the creatures of this world who have targeted humans in various ways so that they can consume them. The humans who were slowly called survivors by themselves began to realize that they were just creatures with soft meat. No shields, sharp teeth, dense fur, tails, sharp claws, and so on. The survivors who realized their weakness began to make use of the only advantage that almost no other living creature had, namely intelligence and mind&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-832013-1&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors slowly began to rise from the feeling of wanting to find a way back home because the longing for the origin and homeland of the survivors would only stab them in the back. They began to try to compete in the survival arena against the various threats that were always lurking around them. Since human is a social creature, togetherness and unity are their previous weapons to rule their home world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors who are creatures with soft flesh enveloping hard bones would probably get such a nickname if they were alone. However, if they unite, even the most terrifying monsters will not be able to defeat them. Their cooperative actions and strategies to stay alive are perhaps the greatest blessings from the One. It is that power that makes the survivors who were initially divided by selfishness begin to unite, and eventually group together to achieve a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the survivors in the Backrooms slowly adapted to their environment, they began to try to survive to fulfill their needs for clothing, food and shelter to prolong their survival. They start hunting, trading, and doing other stuff like back on their home world. The survivors who coordinated between groups in their own survival and benefits began to form a route map from one level to another in an effort to achieve a common mission to make it easier for all survivors to explore without fear of getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The map is being revised &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;I failed to upload it here&lt;/span&gt; so it cannot be displayed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the map shows that there are many levels that can be explored, there are unfortunately some levels that are marked as unsafe to warn survivors to be more alert or even not recommended to pass through that level at all. In addition to unsafe levels, there are also levels that are too safe, and are even used as permanent settlements by survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, although I found the map very strange and confusing, the survivors could understand the map not because it was good, but because they were used to the strange style of the map. Sorry, back on topic. Indeed, in this infinite world, all levels should not be owned by anyone for any reason. Moreover, a level could be 10 times bigger than Earth&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-832013-2&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even the biggest mall in the world can never be entered if the main door is closed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand what that means? Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, normally in this infinite world no level is owned by anyone for any reason, so it&#039;s pretty obvious that a level can&#039;t be controlled. However, if all entrances and exits are heavily guarded or closed, then what? Would the survivors from whatever hitman group or whatever they are be able to pass through the level at will? Of course not, right? They will definitely be dealt with if they are caught breaking through by force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a shame if humans who can finally adapt to this hell even bring up their old nature. None other than greed, gluttony, and a thirst for power or territory. Larger groups began to trample on even slightly weaker groups like trash. They even started over-exploiting resources as well. There was intense competition between these large groups, and then, what&#039;s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, a hell made by humans themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it&#039;s sad that the war that ended in vain even resulted in a huge loss of life, the entire area involved with the war was filled with the corpses of the unlucky survivors. Surely after the war ended, those flesh-eating entities would start popping up around the area. They are smart, “why bother going after the humans? They&#039;ll kill each other anyway.” That&#039;s probably what they would say if they could speak.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-832013-3&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, after several wars that had been fought because they were closely related to the issue of differences between groups. Finally, a system that differentiates between races, beliefs, ideologies and territories was created. Originating from the fear that the territories or resources they control will be used as an advantage for other people or even taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some groups decide to manage the level, or roughly speaking, control the level they occupy to make it more difficult for survivors who are not group members to move freely within the level they control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A level is considered controlled if&amp;#8230; damn, I hate my writing style for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All access in and out of the level is strictly guarded&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point above is that all known entrances and exits will be guarded by members of the relevant group. Usually they build a post around the access and exit area and often there are also those who patrol the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things are done so that the movement of foreign survivors becomes easier to control, or worse, it is even controlled by the owner of the level directly! Although sometimes there are people who forcefully enter the level in various ways, wait! If you are one of those people please &amp;#8230; Ahh why do you pleading anyway? Even if you die I won&#039;t know and of course I don&#039;t care! I don&#039;t want to beg to anyone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful, &lt;strong&gt;I was once almost chopped up&lt;/strong&gt;. The behavior of the level guards depends on the purpose and how valuable the level is, pray if the guards you meet are a bunch of rude people, or worse, a bunch of insane people when you meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survivor travel on the level is taken over, restricted, and even closed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iili.io/2p09egp.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A level that was originally bustling as one of the trading centers after being controlled by a group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On levels controlled by a group, the flow of travel for survivors passing through the level is generally stricter than other levels. Some need to be accompanied by armed guards, have to pay a certain amount of goods in order to pass through the level, and some are even closed to the public. The reason, of course, is because of their group self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resources produced by the level are managed by one group without any interference from other groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group controls a level because it has things that benefit the group. Some have unlimited resources (I remember visiting such a level even though the level was public, I almost died due to the original inhabitants of the level), have strategic entrances and exits to other levels, or just for territory only like the company group that I was once infiltrate easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the points above, it has been confirmed that the level you might be visiting is already under the supervision of a group. If you want to pass through the level, try to follow their rules and not do something that will endanger yourself. So, don&#039;t act stupid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for self-protection you should at least carry a weapon in case they attack you for whatever reason. Or better yet visit in a group with your friends, your family, your prostitutes, your cult or whoever I don&#039;t care so that you can protect each other in case anything goes wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We survivors who might choose to live on our own, freely, without being governed by our superiors, will inevitably have to follow those mindless extortionists. I sincerely hope that the Backrooms won&#039;t just sit still with something that shouldn&#039;t even exist in the dictionary of rules of its world. Earth and Backrooms are the same. There is no clear justice. Justice? What is justice to greedy humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought that fate had sent me to this world to get away from those greedy people and enjoy the rest of my life without any interference from my fellow man. In the end, I was carried along by the swift river with them. Like it or not, I had to follow the rules that were completely unfair in a different world. Perhaps I was being selfish? If I become the most caring person in this universe, will those people care about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These humans should be given a really damn incident to make them realize, because humans will never realize before the disaster comes. Surely they will cry for mercy to the one true God when the rice has become a mush. I don&#039;t like them. However, I am part of them. Maybe I am just a handful of them who realize the rottenness of their nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as there are humans, pollution will never go away. Pollution from everything. They are tormented if a disaster comes, but they themselves invite the disaster to come to them. I predict a worse disaster is coming. An answer from the Backrooms to you, greedy creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will come&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will definitely come&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The behavior of the level guards depends on the purpose and how valuable the level is, pray if the guards you meet are a bunch of rude people, or worse, a bunch of insane people when you meet them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Survivor travel on the level is taken over, restricted, and even closed</strong></li> </ul> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img src="https://iili.io/2p09egp.jpg" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>A level that was originally bustling as one of the trading centers after being controlled by a group</p> </div> </div> <p>On levels controlled by a group, the flow of travel for survivors passing through the level is generally stricter than other levels. Some need to be accompanied by armed guards, have to pay a certain amount of goods in order to pass through the level, and some are even closed to the public. The reason, of course, is because of their group self-interest.</p> <p><strong>The resources produced by the level are managed by one group without any interference from other groups</strong></p> <p>A group controls a level because it has things that benefit the group. Some have unlimited resources (I remember visiting such a level even though the level was public, I almost died due to the original inhabitants of the level), have strategic entrances and exits to other levels, or just for territory only like the company group that I was once infiltrate easily.</p> <hr /> <p>From the points above, it has been confirmed that the level you might be visiting is already under the supervision of a group. If you want to pass through the level, try to follow their rules and not do something that will endanger yourself. So, don't act stupid!</p> <p>Then for self-protection you should at least carry a weapon in case they attack you for whatever reason. Or better yet visit in a group with your friends, your family, your prostitutes, your cult or whoever I don't care so that you can protect each other in case anything goes wrong!</p> <p>We survivors who might choose to live on our own, freely, without being governed by our superiors, will inevitably have to follow those mindless extortionists. I sincerely hope that the Backrooms won't just sit still with something that shouldn't even exist in the dictionary of rules of its world. Earth and Backrooms are the same. There is no clear justice. Justice? What is justice to greedy humans?</p> <p>At first, I thought that fate had sent me to this world to get away from those greedy people and enjoy the rest of my life without any interference from my fellow man. In the end, I was carried along by the swift river with them. Like it or not, I had to follow the rules that were completely unfair in a different world. Perhaps I was being selfish? If I become the most caring person in this universe, will those people care about me?</p> <p>These humans should be given a really damn incident to make them realize, because humans will never realize before the disaster comes. Surely they will cry for mercy to the one true God when the rice has become a mush. I don't like them. However, I am part of them. Maybe I am just a handful of them who realize the rottenness of their nature.</p> <p>As long as there are humans, pollution will never go away. Pollution from everything. They are tormented if a disaster comes, but they themselves invite the disaster to come to them. I predict a worse disaster is coming. An answer from the Backrooms to you, greedy creatures.</p> <p><strong>Soon</strong></p> <p><strong>Will come</strong></p> <p><strong>Will definitely come</strong></p> <p>~ APTX-000</p> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Ự̴͕̙̦̻ͨͣ̐s̥̖͇̥͓͙̼̆̆͛e̸̻͒̓ͤ͋ͯͦ͜͜r̦̬̪̬̩̩͐ͧ͗͌&nbsp;̸̷̜̦̫̝͖͍ͫ̑I̛̞̠͔̮͍̣̯͘ͅn͔͈̹̮̲͒̆̃́͌f̧̹̱̘ͧ̃̿ͣ̄͟o̶̡̗͙̼͎̊̓ͮ̚r̩̜̬̠̞͔͂ͫͨ̕m̶̢̠̟ͫ́̉̿̚͡a̡̺̞̝̖̽̆ͦ̄̄t͙͈̪̩̰̤̔͆̀̅į̯̘̿̊ͩͨ͂̑̚õ͇͉̳̩͖ͬ͑͒͜ń̸̪̟̹̂ͮ̂̀́</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Ŵ̡͓͎̯̞̏̐̀ͮH̰͈̀ͧ̈́́͆͢͠͠Ȳ̷̢̳͇͎̟͐ͥ̈?̷̱̅͌͗͒ͤ͒̚͟?̼͏̶̲̮̳̥̱̔ͧ?͉̟͍͓͆̇̃̑͋͜?̵̢̧̗̱͔̂͛̋͗?̡̱͉̣͆̆́͌̿͘</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p><span style="color: #ff0000">Not Found : 404</span></p> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Name:</strong> levelini.jpg<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bluzyx" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=9480383&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="Bluzyx" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=9480383)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bluzyx" >Bluzyx</a></span><br /> <strong>License:</strong> CC by SA 4.0<br /> <strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://iili.io/2p09egp.jpg">Link</a></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7359971&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763715460" alt="lemme" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7359971)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/lemme" >lemme</a></span></p> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-972321-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page will be updated from time to time and may not be informed to visitors, information of updates may only occur on the branch server. Also, all information below has been modified slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backrooms Indonesia Wiki&lt;/strong&gt; is a Backrooms site that has an independent universe concept so we have some concepts that are not the same as any other branch Backrooms Wiki, this also makes the ID universe a bit confusing for INT readers because of the different concepts used. Below is a list of the differences between ID Wiki and other Wiki branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Wiki Definition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the universe, the ID Wiki is an archive of reports or records of things that have been discovered in Backrooms, be it levels, entities, and so on. Think of this Wiki as your own personal Backrooms instruction manual or guidebook, which will grow in content over time. All the information you get comes from other survivors sharing their information with you, so it&#039;s no surprise that some information is complete, is being studied, is just a rumor, or there is even information that you still don&#039;t know that you need to update quickly. When you see new content on ID Wiki, think of it as someone else is sharing their information about Backrooms to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.1 Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unusable Contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to develop the concept of the ID universe, we restrict the use of non-ID content (such as from the EN branch or from other branches) that falls into the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels (normal, enigmatic, and sub-layers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenomenas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tales and Canons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, ID authors can help each other develop their creativity without having to use or rely on content from other branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usable Contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only non-ID entities and objects can be used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entities and objects related to the points in “unusable content” above are also unusable (e.g. entities/objects that only exist at a non-ID level and that are linked to a canon), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entities and objects from branches other than EN and non-wikidot Wikis are also unusable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note II:&lt;/strong&gt; By mutual decision, the Arustama Project is being held to take more content from EN for use within the ID universe. However, they will be rewritten and will be linked to the ID universe only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.2 Wiki Canon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiki Backrooms Indonesia has taken an unusual path when compared to other Wiki Backrooms branch sites: &lt;strong&gt;Wiki Backrooms Indonesia uses the Single Canon system instead of the No Canon system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The joke article category is not part of the Canon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Differences in Concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several differences in the concept of the ID universe with other branches, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.1 Backrooms Definition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backrooms is a group of another worlds with their own characteristics.&lt;/strong&gt; Further information about this can be found on &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:backrooms-visualization&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entering The Backrooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ID universe, not all survivors enter the Backrooms through the random noclip method like in other Wikis, there are also many who enter the Backrooms through other methods such as entering a forbidden area or breaking a taboo like a myth that is often heard, we call this &lt;em&gt;“Karma”&lt;/em&gt; and the explanation is in &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:karma-intro&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.2 Survivor Term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each branch of the Backrooms wiki has their own term for the humans stranded in the Backrooms such as the term “Wanderers” used by the EN branch and other branches. However, we decided to use the term “Survivors” for the ID universe because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all those in the Backrooms will venture out as they will inevitably choose to stay in levels that are safe to inhabit, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those in the Backrooms basically have to survive due to the difficulty of obtaining resources (food, clothing, and shelter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above points, the term “Survivors” sounds much more suitable for general use than “Wanderers” because this term is used for those who are struggling to survive in difficult/disaster-affected areas, this term also applies both to those stranded in Backrooms and to those who were born and raised in Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read through the ID Wiki, you may come across several terms that refer to a survivor&#039;s job, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explorers&lt;/strong&gt;, those who dedicate themselves to exploring the Backrooms both within a level or looking for new levels, they do this for the sake of knowledge or just to explore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nomads&lt;/strong&gt;, those who live on the move both within a level and between levels, they are not Explorers as they aim to stay where they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archivists&lt;/strong&gt;, those who dedicate themselves to archiving the latest information about Backroons and sharing it publicly. They usually work with Explorers as their source of information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nicknames are rarely used by authors but you can use them in your writing, and you can even create new terms like the ones above. However, those who have these nicknames are still called “Survivors” in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.3 Human Community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people who enter the Backrooms is quite abundant, but because the Backrooms is very large, it is not likely that they can all meet each other. However, that doesn&#039;t mean they can&#039;t meet each other, in some cases they even form groups or even small communities. These survivors are struggling to survive because the level they&#039;re in isn&#039;t always life-supporting or prosperous (it&#039;s very hard just to eat something). Therefore, on the ID universe, the existence of communities/colonies/groups is very rare, and even if they exist, they will only be small in size. The humans (even entities) on ID universe are living under a very difficult situation, so it would be challenging for them to form a large and influential group/community. Not to mention that when humanity is scattered, there will be no groups big enough and famous enough to become the &amp;quot;main group&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additions:&lt;/strong&gt; The humans in the ID universe are not only Indonesian, but global. In other words, the levels in ID Wiki are not limited to Indonesians but can also be filled by foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology Level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors use whatever they can find around them, these can be both old and modern objects although most of them are in a state of disrepair. It is not strange to see survivors using technology that feels outdated or to see them as if they are living in the stone age or iron age. However, that doesn&#039;t mean they are incapable of creating technology from the modern era, they just need to find the resources and tools to do so&amp;#8212;which can be difficult to achieve. This also impacts the types of weaponry, daily equipment, tools, raw materials, transportation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internet in Backrooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know, the existence of the internet in Backrooms is enough to make this world seem safe enough to live in because of the ease of getting information. However, this is not suitable for ID universe concept, which emphasizes the concept of isolation and liminality, so the existence of the internet is quite “disruptive”. However, it&#039;s impossible to get rid of this concept completely because the internet is iconic enough in the global Backrooms communities that it would be strange to get rid of it. A further explanation of how the internet works in ID universe can be found &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:internet-in-backrooms-id&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no money in widespread use. Survivors normally exchange goods or make payments by giving goods of appropriate value. In a large enough community there may be something like money, but for the scattered Survivors out there the exchange of goods system is what they do most often. An exchange of goods should be between goods of equal value or depending on the agreement between the two parties. There are many possibilities! You can read the trading guide on &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:trading-in-backrooms&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.4 Level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Level on ID universe means a “world” that is part of Backrooms, there are many different types of Levels as a result of the creativity of authors. However, not every world concept can be considered a Backrooms Level as some concepts are more akin to a clone of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#039;t let your Level be equal to or better than Earth, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinguish which is Earth and which is not!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mFYd81x.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; alt=&quot;mFYd81x.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site emphasizes isolation and a traditional liminal style, so it&#039;s no wonder most of the uploaded levels feel empty and boring. This is exactly what Backrooms is supposed to be&amp;#8212;a collection of empty worlds with nothing in them but you and a region that feels strangely familiar to you. While Backrooms was originally an indoor area, we don&#039;t prohibit the use of outdoor area themes. We also don&#039;t enforce the use of the &amp;quot;familiar&amp;quot; concept because we don&#039;t want to be too restrictive on the authors, so even the concepts of places that feel &amp;quot;dreamlike&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;very abnormal&amp;quot;, and so on are still allowed to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sub-level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-levels are extra content of an existing level, they can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mixture of two levels (sometimes referred to as a &amp;quot;border&amp;quot;), this area is like the border of two levels and inherits both properties of the levels. However, it still has its own characteristics, making it unique enough to be more than just a border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variation of an existing level. When there are two levels that aren&#039;t differ too much, one of them becomes a &amp;quot;sub-layer&amp;quot; of the existing level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room, as the name implies, is very small and is simply a room or structure that is very different from the surrounding area and not thematically relevant. The room can be in a level or in its own dimension, it can be small or large as long as it is still a room instead of a set of rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects of Interest, are things of interest that can be found in many outdoor-themed levels. They are like Rooms but outside&amp;#8212;equally striking and seemingly out of the theme of the surrounding area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.5 Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of Entities on the ID Wiki includes all forms of life native to the Backrooms, from microorganisms to intelligent life forms, so any lifeforms from Earth would not fit into this category. However, the creativity of the authors has led to so many different types of creatures being proposed to be part of the ID Wiki&#039;s worldbuilding that we had to double-check that the proposed concepts were indeed suitable for the Entity category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-type entities will be labeled with an additional label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.6 Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ID Wiki, objects mean items that are &lt;strong&gt;generally used by survivors&lt;/strong&gt; whether useful or harmful. Think of this category as a guide to what objects you can use broadly/limitedly with other survivors, so objects that only belong to or can only be used by one person/one group will not be included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.7 Phenomena&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost similar to EN, but on ID Wiki, phenomenon refers more to something that can happen &lt;strong&gt;anywhere but rarely&lt;/strong&gt;. Common widely known phenomena such as noclip or phenomena that only occur in a single level would not be included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.8 Enigmatic Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ID Wiki, enigmatic means things that are hard to find, some to the point of being doubted, while others are discovered very rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enigmatic Levels&lt;/strong&gt;, are levels that are difficult to access either because they don&#039;t actually exist or they do exist but are very difficult to enter. Levels that belong to this category are usually just rumors because of the lack of information about them, some survivors claim to have entered these levels but not always with other survivors so the truth about the existence of these levels is in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enigmatic Entities&lt;/strong&gt;, are entities that are very rare to find either because they are very few in number, live in very isolated places, or are a single individual entity. Due to their extremely rare sightings, entities that belong to this category will usually be regarded as “something that could be extinct tomorrow”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.9 Figure of Interest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the figures who are in the spotlight in Backrooms either because of their contributions or because of something else. They could be an entity slayer, expert explorer, celebrity, or even a villain. There is no specific rule about what a character must look like to be included in this category, but there must be some supporting contents (such as a set of stories) that explains why they are in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additions:&lt;/strong&gt; If the character is a non-human or super-powered human who has no solid reason to be in the spotlight, they will fall into the enigmatic entity category. If a character appears repeatedly in multiple stories but does not have a solid reason to be in the spotlight, then it still cannot be put into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Writing Style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make you, the reader of this Wiki/Branch/Hub, a Survivor in the world of Backrooms Indonesia. You have a guidebook, this Wiki/Hub, as a guide to survive in the Backrooms. Therefore, as a guide where you would be staking your life on the information you have, you would be more concerned with the content of the information than the aesthetics, right? This is why the works in ID Wiki are very minimal in terms of narrative and very &amp;quot;to the point&amp;quot;, which also results in a very empty feeling&amp;#8212;like reading information from a location where it doesn&#039;t even feel like it&#039;s all that complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In universe, information distribution can suffer because the majority of Survivors don&#039;t have access to the internet and still do traditional forms of information distribution&amp;#8212;word of mouth, writing, etc. Therefore, it is possible that you, as a Survivor in ID universe, may not get satisfactory information. You may wonder about the details of something, but due to the limitations of technology and knowledge, those details are never known to you. Unlike other Backrooms sites that vary in styles, the works on Wiki ID have such a consistent style that this “emptiness” has become the site&#039;s trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very light and short read, and a writing style that is not too difficult, ID Wiki has become a place where you can write down your ideas without having to struggle with a poetic or very clinical writing style. We don&#039;t want to make things difficult for you and would rather see you get the experience of writing a piece of fiction, even if it&#039;s just a simple piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.1 Name, not number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Backrooms sites use a number to refer to a Level instead of the level name. Strangely, the Entities, Objects and Phenomena categories use the name instead of the number. This inconsistency was not desirable for ID Wiki so we decided to use the level name (or its nickname) to refer to a level in our work&amp;#8212;for example, we would say &amp;quot;Tutorial Level&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Level 0&amp;quot; in our writing. This system of writing makes the level names on ID Wiki more like real place names rather than just a title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.2 Format Screw?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Format Screw is a style of writing where writers don&#039;t follow a set template, they write freely and can be interactive with the reader. Format Screw works are also considered hybrid works because they contain a mixture of two categories of works&amp;#8212;for example, a mixture of report and tale. However, this kind of work is on the gray line of &amp;quot;following the concept of a wiki as a guidebook or not&amp;quot; so we will be quite strict in checking this kind of work later. Creating Format Screw works is not prohibited! However, we have limited the number of Format Screw works to only 1 per 100 works in each category to make them special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wiki ID is a worldbuilding project and the Wiki is their side product”, this statement is not entirely wrong as we will continue to discuss and develop the world of Backrooms Indonesia as if we were a worldbuilding community instead of a writing community. There will be members of the community who ask questions that we never thought of before and will end up growing the worldbuilding of the site. Anyone can participate! So don&#039;t hesitate to join the discussion with us!&lt;/p&gt;

Also, all information below has been modified slightly.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div style="text-align: justify;"> <p><strong>Backrooms Indonesia Wiki</strong> is a Backrooms site that has an independent universe concept so we have some concepts that are not the same as any other branch Backrooms Wiki, this also makes the ID universe a bit confusing for INT readers because of the different concepts used. Below is a list of the differences between ID Wiki and other Wiki branches.</p> <h1><span>1. Wiki Definition</span></h1> <p>According to the universe, the ID Wiki is an archive of reports or records of things that have been discovered in Backrooms, be it levels, entities, and so on. Think of this Wiki as your own personal Backrooms instruction manual or guidebook, which will grow in content over time. All the information you get comes from other survivors sharing their information with you, so it's no surprise that some information is complete, is being studied, is just a rumor, or there is even information that you still don't know that you need to update quickly. When you see new content on ID Wiki, think of it as someone else is sharing their information about Backrooms to you.</p> <h2><span>1.1 Content</span></h2> <h4><span>Unusable Contents</span></h4> <p>In order to develop the concept of the ID universe, we restrict the use of non-ID content (such as from the EN branch or from other branches) that falls into the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Levels (normal, enigmatic, and sub-layers)</li> <li>Phenomenas</li> <li>Groups</li> <li>POIs</li> <li>Tales and Canons</li> </ul> <p>With this, ID authors can help each other develop their creativity without having to use or rely on content from other branches.</p> <h4><span>Usable Contents</span></h4> <p>Only non-ID entities and objects can be used.<br /> <strong>Note:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Entities and objects related to the points in “unusable content” above are also unusable (e.g. entities/objects that only exist at a non-ID level and that are linked to a canon), and</li> <li>Entities and objects from branches other than EN and non-wikidot Wikis are also unusable.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Note II:</strong> By mutual decision, the Arustama Project is being held to take more content from EN for use within the ID universe. However, they will be rewritten and will be linked to the ID universe only.</p> <h2><span>1.2 Wiki Canon</span></h2> <p>Wiki Backrooms Indonesia has taken an unusual path when compared to other Wiki Backrooms branch sites: <strong>Wiki Backrooms Indonesia uses the Single Canon system instead of the No Canon system.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The joke article category is not part of the Canon.</strong></p> </blockquote> <h1><span>2. Differences in Concept</span></h1> <p>There are several differences in the concept of the ID universe with other branches, including:</p> <h2><span>2.1 Backrooms Definition</span></h2> <p><strong>Backrooms is a group of another worlds with their own characteristics.</strong> Further information about this can be found on <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:backrooms-visualization">this page</a>.</p> <h4><span>Entering The Backrooms</span></h4> <p>In ID universe, not all survivors enter the Backrooms through the random noclip method like in other Wikis, there are also many who enter the Backrooms through other methods such as entering a forbidden area or breaking a taboo like a myth that is often heard, we call this <em>“Karma”</em> and the explanation is in <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:karma-intro">this page</a>.</p> <h2><span>2.2 Survivor Term</span></h2> <p>Each branch of the Backrooms wiki has their own term for the humans stranded in the Backrooms such as the term “Wanderers” used by the EN branch and other branches. However, we decided to use the term “Survivors” for the ID universe because:</p> <ul> <li>Not all those in the Backrooms will venture out as they will inevitably choose to stay in levels that are safe to inhabit, and</li> <li>Those in the Backrooms basically have to survive due to the difficulty of obtaining resources (food, clothing, and shelter).</li> </ul> <p>Based on the above points, the term “Survivors” sounds much more suitable for general use than “Wanderers” because this term is used for those who are struggling to survive in difficult/disaster-affected areas, this term also applies both to those stranded in Backrooms and to those who were born and raised in Backrooms.</p> <p>When you read through the ID Wiki, you may come across several terms that refer to a survivor's job, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Explorers</strong>, those who dedicate themselves to exploring the Backrooms both within a level or looking for new levels, they do this for the sake of knowledge or just to explore.</li> <li><strong>Nomads</strong>, those who live on the move both within a level and between levels, they are not Explorers as they aim to stay where they like.</li> <li><strong>Archivists</strong>, those who dedicate themselves to archiving the latest information about Backroons and sharing it publicly. They usually work with Explorers as their source of information.</li> </ul> <p>These nicknames are rarely used by authors but you can use them in your writing, and you can even create new terms like the ones above. However, those who have these nicknames are still called “Survivors” in general.</p> <h2><span>2.3 Human Community</span></h2> <p>The number of people who enter the Backrooms is quite abundant, but because the Backrooms is very large, it is not likely that they can all meet each other. However, that doesn't mean they can't meet each other, in some cases they even form groups or even small communities. These survivors are struggling to survive because the level they're in isn't always life-supporting or prosperous (it's very hard just to eat something). Therefore, on the ID universe, the existence of communities/colonies/groups is very rare, and even if they exist, they will only be small in size. The humans (even entities) on ID universe are living under a very difficult situation, so it would be challenging for them to form a large and influential group/community. Not to mention that when humanity is scattered, there will be no groups big enough and famous enough to become the &quot;main group&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Additions:</strong> The humans in the ID universe are not only Indonesian, but global. In other words, the levels in ID Wiki are not limited to Indonesians but can also be filled by foreigners.</p> <h4><span>Technology Level</span></h4> <p>The survivors use whatever they can find around them, these can be both old and modern objects although most of them are in a state of disrepair. It is not strange to see survivors using technology that feels outdated or to see them as if they are living in the stone age or iron age. However, that doesn't mean they are incapable of creating technology from the modern era, they just need to find the resources and tools to do so&#8212;which can be difficult to achieve. This also impacts the types of weaponry, daily equipment, tools, raw materials, transportation, and more.</p> <h4><span>Internet in Backrooms</span></h4> <p>As we know, the existence of the internet in Backrooms is enough to make this world seem safe enough to live in because of the ease of getting information. However, this is not suitable for ID universe concept, which emphasizes the concept of isolation and liminality, so the existence of the internet is quite “disruptive”. However, it's impossible to get rid of this concept completely because the internet is iconic enough in the global Backrooms communities that it would be strange to get rid of it. A further explanation of how the internet works in ID universe can be found <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:internet-in-backrooms-id">here</a>.</p> <h4><span>Trade</span></h4> <p>There is no money in widespread use. Survivors normally exchange goods or make payments by giving goods of appropriate value. In a large enough community there may be something like money, but for the scattered Survivors out there the exchange of goods system is what they do most often. An exchange of goods should be between goods of equal value or depending on the agreement between the two parties. There are many possibilities! You can read the trading guide on <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/id:trading-in-backrooms">this page</a>.</p> <h2><span>2.4 Level</span></h2> <p>A Level on ID universe means a “world” that is part of Backrooms, there are many different types of Levels as a result of the creativity of authors. However, not every world concept can be considered a Backrooms Level as some concepts are more akin to a clone of Earth.</p> <ul> <li>Don't let your Level be equal to or better than Earth, and</li> <li>Distinguish which is Earth and which is not!</li> </ul> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mFYd81x.jpg" width="300px" alt="mFYd81x.jpg" class="image" /></div> <p>The site emphasizes isolation and a traditional liminal style, so it's no wonder most of the uploaded levels feel empty and boring. This is exactly what Backrooms is supposed to be&#8212;a collection of empty worlds with nothing in them but you and a region that feels strangely familiar to you. While Backrooms was originally an indoor area, we don't prohibit the use of outdoor area themes. We also don't enforce the use of the &quot;familiar&quot; concept because we don't want to be too restrictive on the authors, so even the concepts of places that feel &quot;dreamlike&quot;, &quot;very abnormal&quot;, and so on are still allowed to be used.</p> <h4><span>Sub-level</span></h4> <p>Sub-levels are extra content of an existing level, they can be:</p> <ul> <li>A mixture of two levels (sometimes referred to as a &quot;border&quot;), this area is like the border of two levels and inherits both properties of the levels. However, it still has its own characteristics, making it unique enough to be more than just a border.</li> <li>A variation of an existing level. When there are two levels that aren't differ too much, one of them becomes a &quot;sub-layer&quot; of the existing level.</li> </ul> <h4><span>Structure</span></h4> <ul> <li>Room, as the name implies, is very small and is simply a room or structure that is very different from the surrounding area and not thematically relevant. The room can be in a level or in its own dimension, it can be small or large as long as it is still a room instead of a set of rooms.</li> <li>Objects of Interest, are things of interest that can be found in many outdoor-themed levels. They are like Rooms but outside&#8212;equally striking and seemingly out of the theme of the surrounding area.</li> </ul> <h2><span>2.5 Entity</span></h2> <p>The scope of Entities on the ID Wiki includes all forms of life native to the Backrooms, from microorganisms to intelligent life forms, so any lifeforms from Earth would not fit into this category. However, the creativity of the authors has led to so many different types of creatures being proposed to be part of the ID Wiki's worldbuilding that we had to double-check that the proposed concepts were indeed suitable for the Entity category.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Plant-type entities will be labeled with an additional label.</p> <h2><span>2.6 Object</span></h2> <p>On ID Wiki, objects mean items that are <strong>generally used by survivors</strong> whether useful or harmful. Think of this category as a guide to what objects you can use broadly/limitedly with other survivors, so objects that only belong to or can only be used by one person/one group will not be included in this category.</p> <h2><span>2.7 Phenomena</span></h2> <p>Almost similar to EN, but on ID Wiki, phenomenon refers more to something that can happen <strong>anywhere but rarely</strong>. Common widely known phenomena such as noclip or phenomena that only occur in a single level would not be included in this category.</p> <h2><span>2.8 Enigmatic Category</span></h2> <p>In ID Wiki, enigmatic means things that are hard to find, some to the point of being doubted, while others are discovered very rarely.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Enigmatic Levels</strong>, are levels that are difficult to access either because they don't actually exist or they do exist but are very difficult to enter. Levels that belong to this category are usually just rumors because of the lack of information about them, some survivors claim to have entered these levels but not always with other survivors so the truth about the existence of these levels is in question.</li> <li><strong>Enigmatic Entities</strong>, are entities that are very rare to find either because they are very few in number, live in very isolated places, or are a single individual entity. Due to their extremely rare sightings, entities that belong to this category will usually be regarded as “something that could be extinct tomorrow”.</li> </ul> <h2><span>2.9 Figure of Interest</span></h2> <p>These are the figures who are in the spotlight in Backrooms either because of their contributions or because of something else. They could be an entity slayer, expert explorer, celebrity, or even a villain. There is no specific rule about what a character must look like to be included in this category, but there must be some supporting contents (such as a set of stories) that explains why they are in the spotlight.</p> <p><strong>Additions:</strong> If the character is a non-human or super-powered human who has no solid reason to be in the spotlight, they will fall into the enigmatic entity category. If a character appears repeatedly in multiple stories but does not have a solid reason to be in the spotlight, then it still cannot be put into this category.</p> <h1><span>3.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gloomy Library&lt;/strong&gt; is a modern library whose area mostly consists of a single bookcase aisle with a few larger areas. The total size of this library is unknown as it is quite rare for survivors to visit this level. This level has no entities and no usable objects. Since this level is a library, there are a large number of books in various colors, sizes, and thicknesses that can be found here. However, the books in the level cannot be read due to their abstract text and chaotic images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level has two main structures: a single bookcase aisle less than a meter wide that is well-lit, and a slightly spacious area with rows of tables and chairs inside. Posters, signs, and ornaments can be found randomly along the hallway, but there is a small chance of survivors finding doors&amp;#8212;all of which cannot be opened. However, just like in the book, all the text in this level is randomized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors who have entered this level state that there is nothing in this level but emptiness, so staying too long in the level will give a sense of depression and loneliness. In addition, survivors will not feel tired or need nutrients such as food and water so they can continue to explore the level continuously. However, this can also cause survivors to feel mentally exhausted due to the monotonous structure of the level and its hushed atmosphere like there is no life in it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool temperature and the level&#039;s notoriously dull appearance can induce drowsiness, but since survivors will continue to feel refreshed so they don&#039;t need sleep, these conflicting feelings have been known to frustrate survivors. There are many testimonials that mention how empty and isolating this level is, below is one such testimonial from a survivor who has entered the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-folded&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;collapsible-block-link&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;Open&amp;nbsp;Testimony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-unfolded&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-unfolded-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;collapsible-block-link&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;Tutup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;collapsible-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, Gloomy Library huh? I&#039;ve been there before. Why did I enter it? Let&#039;s just say it was out of intense curiosity. It was an ordinary library but there was only an aisle, not forgetting how the narrow aisle formed a one-lane maze with complicated turns. There&#039;s no need to map this place out in my opinion, it&#039;s not as misleading as you might think. However, the main issue with this level lies in the external effects that you can feel when you arrive here. And it&#039;s because of this effect that this level got its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s empty, cramped, and you won&#039;t be able to find anything other than yourself here. The moment the Backrooms kidnap and eat you is felt here, the cramped and lonely feeling that come from all sides makes you feel as if you&#039;re inside the monster&#039;s throat. Time seems to stand still, making you question whether you should keep moving forward or not. The freshness that keeps coming makes you wonder if it&#039;s a blessing or a curse that you won&#039;t get tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ll also somehow be compelled to keep walking down that narrow and boring aisle over and over again, you won&#039;t know how long and far you&#039;ve walked because your energy never decreases, all you can think of is to keep moving forward hoping to find a way out. You will slowly start to crave for interaction with other creatures, especially humans. You miss their voices, you want to go home as soon as possible, you want to be part of civilization again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense of isolation is very strong, but so is the sense of familiarity. This level somehow reminded me of my school days back on Earth, when I would wander the aisles of bookshelves in search of something interesting to read or to complete an assignment. The place was quiet, but still bustling. There were boring moments, and fun moments. The library was a colorful place where people from many backgrounds gathered for one thing in common, books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I arrived at the Backrooms, I thought that this library would be the same as the one on Earth, but it wasn&#039;t. Everything was quiet and lonely, with no one around. Everything was eerily quiet, there was no reading material to read, and it was just me and the emptiness within this level. And then what happened? All the colorful experiences I&#039;d had turned gray. I was upset, I was bored, I was lonely, and I kept walking endlessly with a soulless outlook. All that mental torture finally stopped when the floor pulled me out of that unpleasant level, I was so happy to finally get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah. There are many similar levels out there, empty levels that isolate and test you mentally to the limit. This level is one of them so those of you who are used to levels like this probably won&#039;t have as many complaints as me. But, to those who are new to this world, you have to strengthen your mentality at all costs because those who are mentally weak will be &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; by the Backrooms&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;not that I&#039;m suggesting you go to levels like this often.&lt;/em&gt; Well, it&#039;s more or less the same as a testing ground like other empty levels, you can go to it if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;Hinge A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bases, Outpost, and Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s no bases, outpost, and communities in this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entrances and Exits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entrances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels can be entered by looking for doors labeled &amp;quot;Library&amp;quot; in both settlement-themed and indoor levels, but sometimes this access may lead survivors to another library-themed level. However, survivors can still recognize this level just by peeking at the indoor design from the door&amp;#8212;if it&#039;s different then it&#039;s another library level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors can only exit this level by noclip into the floor, but this event occurs randomly&amp;#8212;it is unknown where and when it will occur, and will send survivors to another level randomly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
