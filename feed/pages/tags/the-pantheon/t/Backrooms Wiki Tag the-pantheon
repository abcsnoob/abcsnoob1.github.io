&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness, a cold and enveloping feeling of nothingness&amp;#8230; When I opened my eyes, I couldn&#039;t see, I could only feel my body, my existence coming through. And yet&amp;#8230; there was something wrong about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was I alive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No voice guided me. I felt no direction&amp;#8230; There was nothing for me, nothing in my soul. I was a god, but a god of what? What was I made to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t understand anything at all. Only that I felt so lost in a darkness that drowned me whole like a sense of suffocation. When I reached out with my hands, I felt the ground, and I made my way forward, alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nameless, that&#039;s what I was. A god with no identity, &amp;quot;slower&#039; than most. The divine ones were many, War, Chaos, Thought&amp;#8230; They stood above and I was crushed underneath the bottom of the barrel. Scum, an ant. I grew used to it, that feeling of powerlessness. My body concealed in robes from head to toe, all to hide my shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered if I should have just disappeared and eased the burden on my comrades&#039; shoulders. I considered it and pondered further, there was a point where I even acted upon it. Thought about vanishing in the cosmos&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I saw light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pink, warm light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agape, she who incarnated Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she first saw me, she gave me a name. Argos, the bright one. I was confused. Why name me? Why acknowledge me? She simply answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because you are a living being like me. We think, we speak, we feel. Why should I ignore you just because you haven&#039;t found yourself yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t understand her words. She was so different from the others, so&amp;#8230; out of the box. She thought many things that I couldn&#039;t possibly know about. A singular apple paired with oranges. But she was the most shining apple, the only apple in the world, talking to rotten fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to her meticulously, she taught me many things. Life, growth, the beauty of fragile living beings. I learned to embrace such things as part of my bubble of existence. She was my guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Isn&#039;t it beautiful? Every flower, every plant and entity&amp;#8230; They grow, they expand. They have such wonderful lives! Every single thing is deserving of this appreciation, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Life is wonderful, Argos&amp;#8230; You must protect it. Every life form&amp;#8230; Can you promise me that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an oath to her, that every single living being on this world would be under my protection. Even if I was a nameless god to all, to her&amp;#8230; I was Argos the bright one, and Argos&amp;#8230; mattered in the grand scheme of things. That was enough. That was my purpose, and it made her smile so bright that my chest felt like a heated furnace at the sight. Devotion as electrifying as a thousand thunders&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, there was peace. Just me and her in this bubble of safety we created. I wished foolishly for this to be my eternity, but things could not stay still as such forever. Just like she said, the world changes&amp;#8230; time passes. Only we divine ones remain stuck, as if we were not truly part of this dimension, but merely observers. Change came—we were no longer alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings, the day they first broke through the barrier separating our world from theirs&amp;#8230; The Backrooms changed with their arrival, mutating landscapes and creatures, as if it assimilated what human beings carried with them. She was amazed at the way those creatures changed it all. The others were curious, weary, but not her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you seen them, Argos? They grow! They start out so small&amp;#8230; so precious&amp;#8230; The way they feel and think&amp;#8230; It&#039;s amazing! I wish we could be closer to them&amp;#8230; Even just for a while&amp;#8230; That we could&amp;#8230; coexist, learn what they know. It&#039;s my greatest wish&amp;#8230; Do you think one day it could ever come true?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had told her no. That I didn&#039;t believe in said dream as well for even a moment. There is no peace for creatures like us, not in a world that ever changes. Those would just be crushed dreams in a sea of vanished hopes. Her hopes, which I could not fulfill. Because I was too weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&#039;t for my helplessness, my desire to see her happy&amp;#8230; Then&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of it would have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just a normal day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#039;d gone off on her own for the first time. To meet the humans, she said. To share flowers and stories. I let her go because she begged me to. The others wouldn&#039;t have let her, I was the only one she trusted with it&amp;#8230; She smiled at me, reassured me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll be back soon, my dear.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did not return. Never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:nikuchan-theory/Death&quot; width=&quot;300 px&quot; alt=&quot;Death&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I let this happen? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Agape, my burning light, crumbling to dust in my arms. She did not move, her body broken, a withered flower, thousands of withered flowers that died. The extermination of all innocence came with this singular putrid moment, 5 men plucking her petals until nothing remained. I felt my body being torn apart, the more I felt her slip away in my arms, until she vanished like dust in the morning wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is when I finally understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other gods were left gutted out from the inside, unable to handle the idea that they were mortal, that the light holding us all together was gone, just like that. None of us ever died, we were endless&amp;#8230; or so we thought. But they didn&#039;t matter—nothing mattered&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw for the first time the truth of my existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thousand eyes of mine opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became &lt;strong&gt;Justice&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every living being has sin, every living being is rotten. I was going to purge that sin, cleanse every rotten soul. It was that unforgivable act that allowed me to be reborn, guilt and the tremendous agony of loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did she cry for me when they were tearing her part? Did she feel pain in her last moments?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her form would not leave the sight of my thousand eyes. Crumpled flesh and mutilated skin. Her smile, an accusatory thing. It was my fault, she knew it was my fault. That is why I still saw her, even if she was gone. Thousands of her infecting my brain until madness was the closest thing to my situation. Despair, ever so clear, it&#039;s suffocating me. I could not be cleansed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The peeling flesh of her body was a noose around my neck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Forget? Impossible, unforgivable. It was impossible to forget the sight of something engraved in my mind, the sight that was the only thing moving my husk of a body forward. If I forgot, I&#039;d cease to exist. She&#039;d cease to exist&amp;#8230; I could not allow it to happen, not when she died because of my weakness. I carried that burden for far longer than any living being could. The memory was poison, I drank it like acid until it corroded my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal became my sole purpose. I stood by her resting place every day, tainted blood on my hands, begging for her forgiveness. It never cleansed me, nothing could. It was a hopeless penance, grief that tasted like ash, observing the blooming flower that grew through her essence&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tore through humanity, my name became something they feared. Revenge led me to drown in my darkness, to the point I committed atrocious sins just to make humanity feel a quarter of my pain. Yet it wasn&#039;t enough, it never felt enough. Anytime I felt compassion, her mangled body haunting my mind made me forget it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They feared our power, the almighty gods they angered with their sins. They began worshipping us, but that only disgusted me. Mortals only feared what was unkind and stronger than them, putrid vermin&amp;#8230; that is what I would think. I became a monster, something she would have truly despised. I deserved no saving, she deserved to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite the violation and horrible pain, she returned. Smaller, weaker, her flesh, her memories, but not truly &amp;quot;her&amp;quot;. Rebirth, from her own ashes, bathed in light and newfound innocence. I bowed to her, to my Philia, no longer Agape. I had no more tears left to shed, only blind worship for what was left of her. She returned because she had hope, because she could never be a broken, tainted thing like I am. Because despite the horrifying pain, she could only forgive, even by shedding her godly strength. She could only return to save the sinful souls of her loved ones because Agape will always be the wisest out of all of us, a precious soul nobody deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will never let them hurt you ever again. If I fail, I will die for my sins. I will bury myself with you once more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promised paradise to her with those words. An oath that only served to give me purpose, a selfish thing. She knew what I had done, she knew what humankind was capable of now that she was reduced to a broken, wingless goddess. Yet she forgave them—she still loved them. That was perhaps the most painful thing, knowing the death of humankind caused her suffering. Even after everything, I only caused her pain&amp;#8230; I only took out my anger on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are no good or bad people in our reality, just people who commit actions that can be hurtful or not. Argos, I don&#039;t want human beings to die for the sins of only 5 men. It&#039;s not right, no matter what. There is innocence in humanity, there is beauty and kindness alongside the evil. The pain lingers, but I have forgiven&amp;#8230; and I will forgive again. I am no longer Agape, but I continue to exist&amp;#8230; And time continues to march forward. There is no purpose in vengeance any longer, my dear. If you must punish humanity—then punish me too, so I may absolve their sins&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My entire reason for still going even after losing her was fractured by those gentle words. Alien concepts, an understanding of things that we divine beings simply didn&#039;t have. I did not understand, and that only caused me more pain. Yet, she held my face, just like she used to. A gentle press of her palms against my skin. My suffering melted, just like the emptiness in my heart. Just for that moment, I felt pure again, like a newly born fawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Argos, let me show you through my eyes. I need you to understand me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt it. The cry of an infant, the embrace of a mother. A family, sharing what meager food they had together. Lovers, holding hands under the pale moon. Human beings taking care of lesser entities. Love, compassion, innocence devoid of sin. Some sins were so pathetic they hardly made any sense to punish. How could I have been so blind? So&amp;#8230; full of wrath? Even after those vile men were gone, I continued this massacre&amp;#8230; A senseless grief-striken thing&amp;#8230; I&#039;d been blinded. But how could I forgive? How? When they took everything from me? My light&amp;#8230; my reason for living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Promise me&amp;#8230; Promise me you will protect both gods and humans from evil. You must, I beg of you&amp;#8230; Don&#039;t destroy everything because of the rot that surrounds it. Be the hero humanity needs you to be. By the hero I need you to be. Leave the wrath behind and follow what your heart tells you. Your feelings and your mind put together. That is all I ask&amp;#8230; The wishes of a weakened goddess, who has no power in the grand scheme of things. Let me keep this one thing&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not refuse her, never. She returned to me, even if no longer truly her. Despite having opened my eyes long ago, I realized only then I began to truly see and pinpoint my weakness. The same mortal feelings I loathed were the cause of so much suffering. Revenge was not Justice. I failed her tenfold, yet she forgave me, always. She came back to guide me again, to save me from myself. It heightened my guilt, but I would pay her back—I would rebuild this world to be just, for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expanded my influence, and soon enough, those who dreamed of a just world joined me. The Eyes of Argos became the fingers to my hand and the marble making up a temple. They desired to fight evil and protect the innocent as much as I did, with the only objective to find peace, her peace&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a nameless god, I am not Justice the tyrant&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Argos, the all-seeing eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And until this world comes to dust, I will fight&amp;#8230; for the wishes of the innocents and hers, so that my sins will be absolved and the past can be laid to rest, forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It was my fault, she knew it was my fault. That is why I still saw her, even if she was gone. Thousands of her infecting my brain until madness was the closest thing to my situation. Despair, ever so clear, it's suffocating me. I could not be cleansed.</p> <p><em>The peeling flesh of her body was a noose around my neck.</em><br /> Forget? Impossible, unforgivable. It was impossible to forget the sight of something engraved in my mind, the sight that was the only thing moving my husk of a body forward. If I forgot, I'd cease to exist. She'd cease to exist&#8230; I could not allow it to happen, not when she died because of my weakness. I carried that burden for far longer than any living being could. The memory was poison, I drank it like acid until it corroded my mind.</p> <p>My goal became my sole purpose. I stood by her resting place every day, tainted blood on my hands, begging for her forgiveness. It never cleansed me, nothing could. It was a hopeless penance, grief that tasted like ash, observing the blooming flower that grew through her essence&#8230;</p> <p>I tore through humanity, my name became something they feared. Revenge led me to drown in my darkness, to the point I committed atrocious sins just to make humanity feel a quarter of my pain. Yet it wasn't enough, it never felt enough. Anytime I felt compassion, her mangled body haunting my mind made me forget it all.</p> <p>They feared our power, the almighty gods they angered with their sins. They began worshipping us, but that only disgusted me. Mortals only feared what was unkind and stronger than them, putrid vermin&#8230; that is what I would think. I became a monster, something she would have truly despised. I deserved no saving, she deserved to rest.</p> <p>And yet, despite the violation and horrible pain, she returned. Smaller, weaker, her flesh, her memories, but not truly &quot;her&quot;. Rebirth, from her own ashes, bathed in light and newfound innocence. I bowed to her, to my Philia, no longer Agape. I had no more tears left to shed, only blind worship for what was left of her. She returned because she had hope, because she could never be a broken, tainted thing like I am. Because despite the horrifying pain, she could only forgive, even by shedding her godly strength. She could only return to save the sinful souls of her loved ones because Agape will always be the wisest out of all of us, a precious soul nobody deserves.</p> <p>&quot;I will never let them hurt you ever again. If I fail, I will die for my sins. I will bury myself with you once more.&quot;</p> <p>I promised paradise to her with those words. An oath that only served to give me purpose, a selfish thing. She knew what I had done, she knew what humankind was capable of now that she was reduced to a broken, wingless goddess. Yet she forgave them—she still loved them. That was perhaps the most painful thing, knowing the death of humankind caused her suffering. Even after everything, I only caused her pain&#8230; I only took out my anger on the wrong thing.</p> <p>&quot;There are no good or bad people in our reality, just people who commit actions that can be hurtful or not. Argos, I don't want human beings to die for the sins of only 5 men. It's not right, no matter what. There is innocence in humanity, there is beauty and kindness alongside the evil. The pain lingers, but I have forgiven&#8230; and I will forgive again. I am no longer Agape, but I continue to exist&#8230; And time continues to march forward. There is no purpose in vengeance any longer, my dear. If you must punish humanity—then punish me too, so I may absolve their sins&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>My entire reason for still going even after losing her was fractured by those gentle words. Alien concepts, an understanding of things that we divine beings simply didn't have. I did not understand, and that only caused me more pain. Yet, she held my face, just like she used to. A gentle press of her palms against my skin. My suffering melted, just like the emptiness in my heart. Just for that moment, I felt pure again, like a newly born fawn.</p> <p>&quot;Argos, let me show you through my eyes. I need you to understand me.&quot;</p> <p>I felt it. The cry of an infant, the embrace of a mother. A family, sharing what meager food they had together. Lovers, holding hands under the pale moon. Human beings taking care of lesser entities. Love, compassion, innocence devoid of sin. Some sins were so pathetic they hardly made any sense to punish. How could I have been so blind? So&#8230; full of wrath? Even after those vile men were gone, I continued this massacre&#8230; A senseless grief-striken thing&#8230; I'd been blinded. But how could I forgive? How? When they took everything from me? My light&#8230; my reason for living?</p> <p>&quot;Promise me&#8230; Promise me you will protect both gods and humans from evil. You must, I beg of you&#8230; Don't destroy everything because of the rot that surrounds it. Be the hero humanity needs you to be. By the hero I need you to be. Leave the wrath behind and follow what your heart tells you. Your feelings and your mind put together. That is all I ask&#8230; The wishes of a weakened goddess, who has no power in the grand scheme of things. Let me keep this one thing&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>I could not refuse her, never. She returned to me, even if no longer truly her. Despite having opened my eyes long ago, I realized only then I began to truly see and pinpoint my weakness. The same mortal feelings I loathed were the cause of so much suffering. Revenge was not Justice. I failed her tenfold, yet she forgave me, always. She came back to guide me again, to save me from myself. It heightened my guilt, but I would pay her back—I would rebuild this world to be just, for her.</p> <p>I expanded my influence, and soon enough, those who dreamed of a just world joined me. The Eyes of Argos became the fingers to my hand and the marble making up a temple. They desired to fight evil and protect the innocent as much as I did, with the only objective to find peace, her peace&#8230;</p> <p>I am not a nameless god, I am not Justice the tyrant&#8230;</p> <p>I am Argos, the all-seeing eye.</p> <p>And until this world comes to dust, I will fight&#8230; for the wishes of the innocents and hers, so that my sins will be absolved and the past can be laid to rest, forevermore.</p> </div> <p><br /></p> <hr /> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> At the Window<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> At the Window<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> Edward John Pontyer<br /> <strong>License:</strong> Public domain<br /> <strong>Source:</strong> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Poynter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Poynter</a>]</p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> La Maddalena<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> La Maddalena<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo<br /> <strong>License:</strong> Public domain<br /> <strong>Source:</strong> [<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Savoldo_-_La_Maddalena_1533_circa.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Savoldo_-_La_Maddalena_1533_circa.jpg</a>]</p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Filename:</strong> Blood smeared<br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Blood smeared<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> definiteserenade3<br /> <strong>License:</strong> CC BY 2.0<br /> <strong>Source:</strong> [<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/definiteserenade3/4341868725/in/photolist-7BFdiB-5Jfa1e-3oR9AZ-2oi39L-RwJp6z-hJkBZH-3eEyC2-4XJsbd-5bYifA-WMgak5-2iBkwA9-2qTqRCN-2k9WGrk-xgPjB-2mWy2R3-aa7Qtn-2isZomr-2oPF5UY-2isZoda-dKdMV1-5HwZ1W-hyP8c5-2isZopC-2it46uG-ahRFsM-2d7N6Pj-2mPYpDT-2it46wv-8nfgMa-5HMRtL-2mdn8Yo-2oixdEb-7yeh6g-PE4fWv-2crSXde-CNJGZS-2it2XBd-2kRt71p-ci5BKj-21SSHew-WMg89b-2qD4nug-XQHkhP-2it2XDs-2fLDTL2-4vgJTN-8hMz4-6QZA3c-7yegWa-7yegW6">https://www.flickr.com/photos/definiteserenade3/4341868725/in/photolist-7BFdiB-5Jfa1e-3oR9AZ-2oi39L-RwJp6z-hJkBZH-3eEyC2-4XJsbd-5bYifA-WMgak5-2iBkwA9-2qTqRCN-2k9WGrk-xgPjB-2mWy2R3-aa7Qtn-2isZomr-2oPF5UY-2isZoda-dKdMV1-5HwZ1W-hyP8c5-2isZopC-2it46uG-ahRFsM-2d7N6Pj-2mPYpDT-2it46wv-8nfgMa-5HMRtL-2mdn8Yo-2oixdEb-7yeh6g-PE4fWv-2crSXde-CNJGZS-2it2XBd-2kRt71p-ci5BKj-21SSHew-WMg89b-2qD4nug-XQHkhP-2it2XDs-2fLDTL2-4vgJTN-8hMz4-6QZA3c-7yegWa-7yegW6</a>]</p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8144627&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713086" alt="Nikuchan " style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8144627)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" >Nikuchan</a></span></p>

&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;From the depths of the world, the palest of flowers bloomed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Petals glistened under the light; the flower of the lake arose, and thus, Love was made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;She opened her eyes, innocent and perfect. She was beauty incarnate, something nothing could tarnish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Those irises of hers, pink as the dawning sky, containing all the knowledge of the world. A form still unknown, but ever so ethereal. Love let out a call, and the world responded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;The beasts responded. They warmed Love, fed her, and surrounded her, welcoming their Mother. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/pantheon-hub&quot;&gt;The divine ones&lt;/a&gt; kneeled, for she was the veil holding them together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Love was adorned with pearls and flowers, for she was a Bride, a Wife, a Mother, Sister and a Daughter. Her laughter made new kin, and her touch made colors brighten to welcome her. All living things cheered for the creation of the great one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;She loved and was loved; centuries flew by as the world proceeded in a never-ending march. A paradise for the alien, the artificial oddities of an unknown world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Then, mankind came.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Flesh, skin, organs. Fragile lives, descendants of apes. Wielding rocks and plucking berries. Ripped from their world by a simple mistake. First they were few, then they were many. Love&#039;s heart was stolen by such a fragile existence. A deep, abiding marriage of the soul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Love watched them from afar, observing and learning. She assumed forms similar to them and studied the essence that incarnates humanity, with the desire to be human too. A woman in flesh and bones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Yet, women bled, suffered, and carried their kin in their flesh. She could not. Never bleed, never blossom, never suffer. An empty womb, the ethereal imitation of what is human. Why must she be different? Was she flawed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;What is a Mother with children not born of her flesh? What is a Sister who bears no family? What is a daughter that was made, not born? What is a Bride who cannot unite with her Groom?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Mankind worshipped her, even in her artificial anomaly. They called her Philia, the Saintess. A name, an identity, a form. They sculpted her and prayed for her. Thus, she was reborn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;The other ones kept her hidden. They&#039;d say she was fragile, a flower to nurture in glass. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-71&quot;&gt;War&lt;/a&gt; mourned with her, &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-74&quot;&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; needed her, and Death did not understand her. They feared the unknown, and Philia became their muse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;She served humanity, becoming the beacon of their hopes. They founded a town, Hoofstad, in her name. The town of love, the beginning of civilisation. Philia witnessed its birth, its evolution, and its end, as if it all passed in seconds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Humanity was her deepest love, something Philia could never let go of, no matter the passage of time. Their younglings, so soft and innocent. Their elders, so full of knowledge. The women, the men, and those who were neither. Each one of them was loved from the bottom of her heart. She needed them, even if she tore herself apart to be one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Then, the greatest happiness, a small bundle of joy. A human boy, innocent, orphaned. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/komo-oide-and-philia&quot;&gt;Nunca&lt;/a&gt;, child of Love and Humour. Her kin, even if not truly hers in flesh, he&#039;d been hers in name. His smile, his soft hands, his voice calling for Mother. He was the perfect piece in the gaping hole of her heart, alongside the divine ones and humanity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;The second piece of happiness, her other half. Thought itself, rational, unfeeling, and unloved. An infatuation so strong that he began feeling that he yearned for her. He was her brain; she was his heart. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fengari-god-of-thoughts&quot;&gt;Fengàri&lt;/a&gt;, born a man in woman&#039;s flesh. Forever a man to her, forever lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Humanity&#039;s worship crumbled, as the divine ones did not understand the full extent of what is human. Mistake upon mistake&amp;#8230; loss and misunderstanding, until mankind roared in rebellion against the rule of the divine ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Philia&#039;s marriage was broken, her home was tarnished, and her heart was ripped in pieces. The city of beginnings was divided, and the divine ones were cast away, exiled for the sins they did not comprehend, for they&#039;d been assigned these roles when they&#039;d been just simple, alien creatures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;And then, clad in putrid robes, Stupor came. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/greyking-unparalleled&quot;&gt;Y&#039;liad Elyion&lt;/a&gt;, the feared blade of Bittersteel. For his quest for stillness, most of humankind perished. Towns destroyed, souls collected. The blame fell on the divine ones for Stupor&#039;s mistakes. It was war for the loss of innocent flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist&quot;&gt;They&lt;/a&gt; formed the fingers of a hand, the celestial bodies of the sky. They swore protection, revenge, and independence from what they once blindly created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Humans reunited under one name so they could purge those they deemed evil and sinful. A war that would last for eons. The betrayal of Death, who chose to become their leader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Philia witnessed the carnage of thousands, human and divine, lost because of a senseless search for justice. In this conflict, her cherished pieces of happiness vanished. A grieving mother, a son who died to protect her. An empty home, a boy that will laugh no more. The grief is all-consuming, a never-ending pit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;The second piece of happiness, her soulmate driven to madness by humanity&#039;s betrayal. The greater Thought sealed him away from the pain and from his beloved until he lost every piece of himself. A Bride left grieving at her altar, without any grave to kneel by. That was perhaps the most painful thing, to be left as a Widow with no child to call her own. A nameless woman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;The war ceased when there was no more blood left to spill. When the divine ones vanished into the depths of the world and became like old legends of the past. Philia was the only one left to mourn. She was no longer loved, no longer a Goddess, no longer anything. She could only cry to an infinite, deaf void.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;She travels through the labyrinth, forgotten and abandoned. A shadow of herself, waiting for the day until there will be peace and unity anew. She wanders and weeps, and those tears drip into an ocean of sorrow. Until she ascends once more, as the other divine ones awaken from their slumber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Left with no choice, she fell into an eternal sleep&amp;#8230; until the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/tournesol&quot;&gt;Rose&lt;/a&gt; blooms and awakens her once more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Precursive&quot;&gt;Glory to the forgotten Love of this world. May she hear this forgotten Ode. May her tears heal the wounds of her heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

She was beauty incarnate, something nothing could tarnish.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Those irises of hers, pink as the dawning sky, containing all the knowledge of the world. A form still unknown, but ever so ethereal. Love let out a call, and the world responded.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">The beasts responded. They warmed Love, fed her, and surrounded her, welcoming their Mother. <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/pantheon-hub">The divine ones</a> kneeled, for she was the veil holding them together.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Love was adorned with pearls and flowers, for she was a Bride, a Wife, a Mother, Sister and a Daughter. Her laughter made new kin, and her touch made colors brighten to welcome her. All living things cheered for the creation of the great one.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">She loved and was loved; centuries flew by as the world proceeded in a never-ending march. A paradise for the alien, the artificial oddities of an unknown world.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Then, mankind came.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Flesh, skin, organs. Fragile lives, descendants of apes. Wielding rocks and plucking berries. Ripped from their world by a simple mistake. First they were few, then they were many. Love's heart was stolen by such a fragile existence. A deep, abiding marriage of the soul.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Love watched them from afar, observing and learning. She assumed forms similar to them and studied the essence that incarnates humanity, with the desire to be human too. A woman in flesh and bones.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Yet, women bled, suffered, and carried their kin in their flesh. She could not. Never bleed, never blossom, never suffer. An empty womb, the ethereal imitation of what is human. Why must she be different? Was she flawed?</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">What is a Mother with children not born of her flesh? What is a Sister who bears no family? What is a daughter that was made, not born? What is a Bride who cannot unite with her Groom?</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Mankind worshipped her, even in her artificial anomaly. They called her Philia, the Saintess. A name, an identity, a form. They sculpted her and prayed for her. Thus, she was reborn.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">The other ones kept her hidden. They'd say she was fragile, a flower to nurture in glass. <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-71">War</a> mourned with her, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-74">Justice</a> needed her, and Death did not understand her. They feared the unknown, and Philia became their muse.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">She served humanity, becoming the beacon of their hopes. They founded a town, Hoofstad, in her name. The town of love, the beginning of civilisation. Philia witnessed its birth, its evolution, and its end, as if it all passed in seconds.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Humanity was her deepest love, something Philia could never let go of, no matter the passage of time. Their younglings, so soft and innocent. Their elders, so full of knowledge. The women, the men, and those who were neither. Each one of them was loved from the bottom of her heart. She needed them, even if she tore herself apart to be one of them.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Then, the greatest happiness, a small bundle of joy. A human boy, innocent, orphaned. <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/komo-oide-and-philia">Nunca</a>, child of Love and Humour. Her kin, even if not truly hers in flesh, he'd been hers in name. His smile, his soft hands, his voice calling for Mother. He was the perfect piece in the gaping hole of her heart, alongside the divine ones and humanity.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">The second piece of happiness, her other half. Thought itself, rational, unfeeling, and unloved. An infatuation so strong that he began feeling that he yearned for her. He was her brain; she was his heart. <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fengari-god-of-thoughts">Fengàri</a>, born a man in woman's flesh. Forever a man to her, forever lost.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Humanity's worship crumbled, as the divine ones did not understand the full extent of what is human. Mistake upon mistake&#8230; loss and misunderstanding, until mankind roared in rebellion against the rule of the divine ones.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Philia's marriage was broken, her home was tarnished, and her heart was ripped in pieces. The city of beginnings was divided, and the divine ones were cast away, exiled for the sins they did not comprehend, for they'd been assigned these roles when they'd been just simple, alien creatures.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">And then, clad in putrid robes, Stupor came. <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/greyking-unparalleled">Y'liad Elyion</a>, the feared blade of Bittersteel. For his quest for stillness, most of humankind perished. Towns destroyed, souls collected. The blame fell on the divine ones for Stupor's mistakes. It was war for the loss of innocent flesh.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive"><a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist">They</a> formed the fingers of a hand, the celestial bodies of the sky. They swore protection, revenge, and independence from what they once blindly created.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Humans reunited under one name so they could purge those they deemed evil and sinful. A war that would last for eons. The betrayal of Death, who chose to become their leader.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Philia witnessed the carnage of thousands, human and divine, lost because of a senseless search for justice. In this conflict, her cherished pieces of happiness vanished. A grieving mother, a son who died to protect her. An empty home, a boy that will laugh no more. The grief is all-consuming, a never-ending pit.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">The second piece of happiness, her soulmate driven to madness by humanity's betrayal. The greater Thought sealed him away from the pain and from his beloved until he lost every piece of himself. A Bride left grieving at her altar, without any grave to kneel by. That was perhaps the most painful thing, to be left as a Widow with no child to call her own. A nameless woman.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">The war ceased when there was no more blood left to spill. When the divine ones vanished into the depths of the world and became like old legends of the past. Philia was the only one left to mourn. She was no longer loved, no longer a Goddess, no longer anything. She could only cry to an infinite, deaf void.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">She travels through the labyrinth, forgotten and abandoned. A shadow of herself, waiting for the day until there will be peace and unity anew. She wanders and weeps, and those tears drip into an ocean of sorrow. Until she ascends once more, as the other divine ones awaken from their slumber.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Left with no choice, she fell into an eternal sleep&#8230; until the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/tournesol">Rose</a> blooms and awakens her once more.</span></p> <p><span class="Precursive">Glory to the forgotten Love of this world. May she hear this forgotten Ode. May her tears heal the wounds of her heart.</span></p> </div> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/philia-rewrite/Philia%20end" alt="" width="500 px" class="image" /></div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/love-and-grief">Love and Grief</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/komo-oide-and-philia">Komo'oide and Philia</a> | Ode to Love | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/tournesol">Tournesol</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p>Filename: sakura<br /> Author: houroumono<br /> License: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">CC BY 2.0</a><br /> Source Link: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hourou/6909463032/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/hourou/6909463032/</a><br /> <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> This image has been edited.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Filename: Philia<br /> Author: de_cember7th<br /> License: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA-3.0</a><br /> Filename: Miranda - John William Waterhouse.jpg</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Author: John William Waterhouse<br /> License: Public domain<br /> Source Link: <a href="https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Miranda_-_John_William_Waterhouse.jpg">https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Miranda_-_John_William_Waterhouse.jpg</a><br /> Additional Notes: Cut, hair slightly edited</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Filename: Miranda - John William Waterhouse.jpg<br /> Author: Busition<br /> License: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA-4.0</a><br /> Source Link: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abandoned_Westfield_Promenade.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abandoned_Westfield_Promenade.jpg</a><br /> Additional Notes: Article image mashup made by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8055329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713086" alt="scutoid studios" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8055329)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios" >scutoid studios</a></span></p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8144627&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713086" alt="Nikuchan " style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8144627)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" >Nikuchan</a></span></p>

These manuscripts were written roughly eleven million years ago within the Lost Temple or City of the Fifty-first Domain and were translated with the combined efforts and capabilities of the Academia in the Study of the History and Literature of the Lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Merely a few leagues away, the paleness that the clouds seem to epitomize as the encroaching figure of the unworthy approaches the shining walls of Hoofstad settles an uncanny feeling in the guts of fearing mortals. The heavy fog of the horizon envelops him as if he were a wraith, clinging to him like the miasma of corpse fluid. In his right hand was a shining silver shaped into a simple twain-bladed sword, dragging and dragging along the soil as it carves a path of infertility in its wake. If it were not for the banshee-like wailings that escape the otherwise clean shining blade, it would surely be mistaken for the common tool of infantry. Nevertheless, the maddening yet familiar voices that attempted to sober up from eldritch stupor had heralded his looming presence. And it was only growing louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; I was kneeling before the altar of the Warrior, praying for his protection. I had fled from the unworthy by miracle in that village long desecrated. Beside me, and similarly, thousands hush in holy communion, clutching in their hands symbols of faith that they remain to stand by until the end. Alas, it made me realize how hollow my prayer was. I had lost my faith in gods as I had lost my feelings from bearing witness to such&amp;#8230; scenes of terror I never thought possible. Certain am I that even if I had then praised the Warrior, the Saintess, and every god that ever existed and has yet to exist, there would have been no difference in the way that exact memory had occurred. No gods ever descended from their heavens. Nor did their chosen ones, their champions, which embody what they are supposed to realize in this plane of existence, ever intervene in the slaughter. Even now, there is no answer from the thousands that attempt to call even one of their blessed kind. What kind of reason do these deified beings say when they arrive late? Or when they had not noticed that one of their own, even though more putrid and filthy than the rest of them, had come to vanquish the holy city they call their council?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; Outside, there was rumbling. The eerie crackle of thunder. The sharpness of ominous winds carving the yet godless city. There was fear, but the thousands believed in the holy impenetrability of the temple walls and gates. Their prayers grew louder, drowning out what the noises threatened towards their ephemerality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; There was a gentle tap on the glorious gates of the temple. It was faint, like the touch of an infant caressing the cheek of its mother. But it was there. It was silent at first. I was watching every person among the thousands kneeling and praying rise with confusion. The next moment, there was a hand&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;melting through like a hot knife on tallow&lt;/em&gt;. Then an arm&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;melting through&lt;/em&gt;. A visage&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;melting through like hot knife on tallow&lt;/em&gt;. A glimmer of silver &lt;em&gt;melting through&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; It felt like waiting for water to boil inside a kettle. The whistle in the wind grows louder. The air felt heavy on my shoulders. There was a momentary pause, calm before the storm. Familiar, I thought. It was familiar. Then I saw a silver shine and felt my cheek run hot crimson. Heads, turning to run almost, smoothly rise&amp;#8230; and splatter on white marble. A hundred corpses before me. A hundred corpses before me not. There was a distinct perforation on the gate&amp;#8230; and there was him. Towering, looking down as blood rains on him. There were no longer corpses&amp;#8230; just a pool of red. All of them, the instant their heads so much as graze the marble floor, vanished. The only proof of such bodies ever existing were their cries being silenced by the silver thing that slithered like a snake with horse teeth, burping disgustingly as it crunched on bones and sinew. He was almost sad. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; He swings his sword hand; another hundred rise and splatter and vanish. Then another, and another, and another&amp;#8230; I felt shoulders bumping mine. I heard the cries of people, their once-hush footsteps in respect to the gods now sprinting in full. I felt an arm grab me. Then I ran as well. The same way I ran away from the village. The same way that memory occurred. I felt the slash of the wind, the feeling of lightness. The next moment I turned to look, my left arm was no longer there. He was walking towards the running herd. Walking towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt; The dash to escape the temple was both excruciating and mind-numbing. The noises the people were making were that of sheep, crying and begging to their deities in futility and hopelessness. I found myself one of the few to leave the shining monolith with only the disappearance of a limb, let alone with my life. The city was painted with the red of common folk. I could not set sight upon a single corpse strewn here or there, their blood the sole evidence of massacre. Hoofstad was perfectly preserved in unholy disarray.&lt;/p&gt;

Ink and quill. I write at last these final words to whomever may discover the atrocities of the unworthy. However, I suppose the state with which he desecrated the city would hopefully be enough of an image of his blasphemy against whatever remains of any holy conduct. For he is no god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Aside from brief references of his actions in the Fifty-first Domain in other later literatures, he is completely vanished from the history of the Lost. What remains of him, his name, and legacy are bound alone within this book we compiled in hopes of spreading meaningful information about this realm&#039;s rich but convoluted history, especially within the Lost, to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;#32;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Merely a few leagues away, the paleness that the clouds seem to epitomize as the encroaching figure of the unworthy approaches the shining walls of Hoofstad settles an uncanny feeling in the guts of fearing mortals. The heavy fog of the horizon envelops him as if he were a wraith, clinging to him like the miasma of corpse fluid. In his right hand was a shining silver shaped into a simple twain-bladed sword, dragging and dragging along the soil as it carves a path of infertility in its wake. If it were not for the banshee-like wailings that escape the otherwise clean shining blade, it would surely be mistaken for the common tool of infantry. Nevertheless, the maddening yet familiar voices that attempted to sober up from eldritch stupor had heralded his looming presence. And it was only growing louder.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> I was kneeling before the altar of the Warrior, praying for his protection. I had fled from the unworthy by miracle in that village long desecrated. Beside me, and similarly, thousands hush in holy communion, clutching in their hands symbols of faith that they remain to stand by until the end. Alas, it made me realize how hollow my prayer was. I had lost my faith in gods as I had lost my feelings from bearing witness to such&#8230; scenes of terror I never thought possible. Certain am I that even if I had then praised the Warrior, the Saintess, and every god that ever existed and has yet to exist, there would have been no difference in the way that exact memory had occurred. No gods ever descended from their heavens. Nor did their chosen ones, their champions, which embody what they are supposed to realize in this plane of existence, ever intervene in the slaughter. Even now, there is no answer from the thousands that attempt to call even one of their blessed kind. What kind of reason do these deified beings say when they arrive late? Or when they had not noticed that one of their own, even though more putrid and filthy than the rest of them, had come to vanquish the holy city they call their council?</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> Outside, there was rumbling. The eerie crackle of thunder. The sharpness of ominous winds carving the yet godless city. There was fear, but the thousands believed in the holy impenetrability of the temple walls and gates. Their prayers grew louder, drowning out what the noises threatened towards their ephemerality.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> There was a gentle tap on the glorious gates of the temple. It was faint, like the touch of an infant caressing the cheek of its mother. But it was there. It was silent at first. I was watching every person among the thousands kneeling and praying rise with confusion. The next moment, there was a hand&#8230; <em>melting through like a hot knife on tallow</em>. Then an arm&#8230; <em>melting through</em>. A visage&#8230; <em>melting through like hot knife on tallow</em>. A glimmer of silver <em>melting through</em>.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> It felt like waiting for water to boil inside a kettle. The whistle in the wind grows louder. The air felt heavy on my shoulders. There was a momentary pause, calm before the storm. Familiar, I thought. It was familiar. Then I saw a silver shine and felt my cheek run hot crimson. Heads, turning to run almost, smoothly rise&#8230; and splatter on white marble. A hundred corpses before me. A hundred corpses before me not. There was a distinct perforation on the gate&#8230; and there was him. Towering, looking down as blood rains on him. There were no longer corpses&#8230; just a pool of red. All of them, the instant their heads so much as graze the marble floor, vanished. The only proof of such bodies ever existing were their cries being silenced by the silver thing that slithered like a snake with horse teeth, burping disgustingly as it crunched on bones and sinew. He was almost sad. Almost.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> He swings his sword hand; another hundred rise and splatter and vanish. Then another, and another, and another&#8230; I felt shoulders bumping mine. I heard the cries of people, their once-hush footsteps in respect to the gods now sprinting in full. I felt an arm grab me. Then I ran as well. The same way I ran away from the village. The same way that memory occurred. I felt the slash of the wind, the feeling of lightness. The next moment I turned to look, my left arm was no longer there. He was walking towards the running herd.

The noises the people were making were that of sheep, crying and begging to their deities in futility and hopelessness. I found myself one of the few to leave the shining monolith with only the disappearance of a limb, let alone with my life. The city was painted with the red of common folk. I could not set sight upon a single corpse strewn here or there, their blood the sole evidence of massacre. Hoofstad was perfectly preserved in unholy disarray.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> Presently, I find myself in some disheveled study. Ink and quill. I write at last these final words to whomever may discover the atrocities of the unworthy. However, I suppose the state with which he desecrated the city would hopefully be enough of an image of his blasphemy against whatever remains of any holy conduct. For he is no god.</p> </div> </div> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br /> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></p> <div class="lightblock"> <h1><span><strong>ANNOTATION OF REGARYA</strong></span></h1> <div style="text-align: left;"> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span> <span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>A</strong></span>s of the Twenty-first Century, through the effort of our institution the Academia in the Study of the History and Literature of the Lost, there have been no other authenticated scriptures relating to the religious figure known as Y'liad Elyion.

&lt;p&gt;The hub contains spoilers. Because of the complexity of the canon and the sheer amount of worldbuilding, I have to explain things in detail. You can read the &amp;quot;Main Storyline&amp;quot; Levels first or this hub first&amp;#8230; The decision belongs to you my friend ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author note: This canon can be considered as a &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; scenario, for the most part, and isn&#039;t part of the original reverence lore. &amp;quot;Origins&amp;quot; is an original piece only showing some aspects of the actual reverence without diving into the lore intended by its original authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption is a parasite that starts from a single host. Leave it some time and it will multiply, again, and ever again until everyone is infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;Origins&amp;quot; canon, humanity is on the verge of collapse, threatened by its own kind.&lt;br /&gt;
The major groups of interests and human communities have fallen after the attacks of December 25, 2024. Starting from this date, a new era for humanity has begun.&lt;br /&gt;
An era of terror where both humans and entities can threaten your survival.&lt;br /&gt;
Where no one can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is however one last remaining resistance, one last hope for humanity to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that Richard S. Delacroix is the main antagonist of this canon, but have you ever wondered what drove him to commit all those atrocious acts? Certainly, he is by no means forgiven, but this storyline attempts to answer the question: &amp;quot;Should mankind be part of the Backrooms?&amp;quot;. And what side are you on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seras Valentina was once a M.E.G. operative full of hope. She is the central character of Paradise 997 and suffered severe mental trauma after her horrific journey through this Level, almost breaking her. Ever since that day, she prepared herself to take revenge on the ones who betrayed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This storyline bring a focus to the Ariane Circle and their research team Apollo. While the Ariane Circle is probably the most pleasant group to work with, explained by their strong sense of brotherhood, they also remain highly professional in their tasks, solving a mystery that will change the power balance between Liberation and the Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

Did the canon inspire you? Do you wish to write an article and expand the story? Any contributions are welcome! I will include your work in this hub and guide you if you have any questions. If that&#039;s the case, feel free to contact me by Wikidot DM or via Discord (I have the same name).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: Although the main story ends in Act IV, there&#039;s nothing to stop you writing something that takes place after the events of Act IV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to write an article about this canon, you can write about pretty much anything; such as additional characters (they can be separate from the main casting and have their own story set in that universe). You can also write about additional paradises/levels, GOIs and various side stories at any timeline of the canon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The infamous faction of the reverence, founded by the undercover reverence member Father Richard Simmons Delacroix, known as &amp;quot;Overseer S&amp;quot; when he was infiltrated within the M.E.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite sharing the same objective as the reverence, which is returning to the past. Liberation is rather a separate faction and identifies itself as an organized religious fanatical group. They are the ones behind the attacks of December 25, a global-scale terrorist attack that led to the fall of nearly all groups of interest and communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After their successful assault, they massively strengthened their power and assets, established an oppressive regime all over the Backrooms, and recruited many new &amp;quot;apostles&amp;quot; to prepare for the final assault that will determine humanity&#039;s fate in the Backrooms forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They do not kill, nor have they ever killed, any entity, even if their own lives are threatened. Because if one of their apostles were to kill an entity he or she would get punished on the spot. This can&#039;t be said for humans where they persecute them as much as they can.&lt;/em&gt;‎&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bases and Outposts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondary Headquarters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production Sites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outpost Limbo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outposts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;yui-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-770&quot;&gt;Site 770&lt;/a&gt; is Liberation&#039;s first established outpost that became their main center of command. Although cut off from the rest of the Backrooms, Liberation uses it as an advantage to keep its activities secret and secured. This includes their various projects, operations and classified data, all stored in their main database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-1&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is impossible to communicate with the main headquarters from the Backrooms main lands, Liberation had to set up another command center: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Site 4&lt;/a&gt;. Level 4 being a relatively safe office space was considered the most strategic location for this role. Site 4 is therefore the core of Liberation&#039;s activities within the Backrooms main lands, with &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot; as both Site Director and Chief of Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-2&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Site 11&lt;/a&gt; is a large research center located in the District 7 of Level 11. They have all the equipment needed at their disposal to carry out all kinds of experiments, and for that reason, Site 11 is one of the most protected assets of Liberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wiki-tab-0-3&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3&quot;&gt;Site 3&lt;/a&gt; is a telecommunication center located in a large control room within Level 3. Site 3 is also one of Liberation&#039;s most protected assets, as they control all unsecured communications feeds and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-21&quot;&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; flux on the Backrooms&#039; main lands. This allows Liberation to eavesdrop and spread disinformation on almost every device connected to the Backrooms&#039; network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1&quot;&gt;Site 1&lt;/a&gt; is Liberation&#039;s largest outpost. Nicknamed “Outpost Limbo” because of its location on the second level of the Backrooms, just after &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;The Lobby&lt;/a&gt;. This outpost allows a very large number of Liberation patrols to “secure” Level 1, turning this once-safe level into hostile territory for any wanderers who find themselves there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, Entity 997-A, The Sacred One, Our dearest Creator, Saint Nature&amp;#8230; All these terms refer to the mysterious entity supposedly controlling everything within the lands of Liberation. However, the entity has absolutely no power or control outside its realm, and therefore relies on Liberation to carry out its wishes within the Backrooms. It is theorized that the entity can create several manifestations of itself, each with a distinct consciousness but all linked to its host. Its very existence is uncertain as nobody witnessed its physical existence; some might say that it is just a hallucination or a phenomenon. The Patriarch is the only known human to have directly communicated with this &amp;quot;entity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More commonly referred to as &amp;quot;the Resistance&amp;quot;, the Syndicate is a coalition founded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens/offset/2&quot;&gt;Masked Maidens&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-eyes-of-argos&quot;&gt;Eyes of Argos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-u-e-c&quot;&gt;U.E.C.&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-robotics&quot;&gt;Backrooms Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-eternal-repository&quot;&gt;Eternal Repository&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr-backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/cercle-ariane&quot;&gt;Ariane Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the remain of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are the last remaining opposing force to Liberation and the last hope for humanity.&lt;br /&gt;
However, due to the severity of the situation they can&#039;t afford to play it safe. Leading them to engage in morally questionable acts, but more often in spite of their will.&lt;/em&gt;‎&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former M.E.G. operative, Seras resigned from the group after her horrific journey in Level 997, where her only best friend and teammate Lieutenant Antoine Belfort died. She&#039;s been holding a strong grudge against Overseer S ever since and is preparing for her revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseer Adrian, is the leader of Team Overseer and the founder of the M.E.G.&lt;br /&gt;
He built what used to be the largest group of the Backrooms; The M.E.G. was seen as humanity&#039;s savior, ensuring the Backrooms population&#039;s safety. However, the tables turned after the attacks of December 25, the M.E.G. lost all its reputation and most of its members either died or defected the group. Published damage reports indicate that M.E.G. suffered a loss of around 85% of its power and assets. Adrian, left with no other choices joined the coalition with his few remaining loyal members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H.D.F. grand marshal. C.McNamara thought Liberation was just baseless conspiracy at first but the suspicious behavior of his own comrade secretly working for Liberation opened his eyes to the truth. The U.E.C. lost nearly all of their assets and members, unlike their own task force, the H.D.F. who, despite having lost their main base on Level 422, managed to cut their human losses. They now form the main line of defense and attack for the Syndicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Lancelot is one of the Ariane Circle&#039;s Veteran Council members and appointed leader of The Ariane Circle division within the Syndicate. Their group is a valuable perk for the resistance as they have teams specialized in many domains. The most notable ones are Team Hermes, specialized in exploration and scouting), Team Pytheas (specialized in communication and diplomacy) and Team Apollo (specialized in science and research). The knowledge and experience of Team Hermes and Team Pytheas, in particular, allow the Syndicate to reduce the impact caused by Liberation&#039;s scout &amp;quot;Stalker&amp;quot; and Liberation&#039;s communication officer &amp;amp; diplomat &amp;quot;Auditor&amp;quot;. While Team Apollo focuses its efforts on the mysterious entity 77X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lead Scientist of The Ariane Circle research team: Team Appolo. Endowed of both an unmatched perspicacity and a remarkable benevolence for his team members and allies, Doctor Archange has forged a reputation of a Saint, appreciated and recognized by the vast majority of the scientific circle within the Backrooms, including the M.E.G.

&lt;p&gt;He was a former member of the French&#039;s 11th Parachute Brigade who accidentally no-clipped into the Backrooms after a parachute malfunction during a mission. His survival skills and military expertise were assets the M.E.G. couldn’t ignore. Though initially reluctant, he eventually agreed to join Overseer S&#039; newly formed &amp;quot;Team Sierra&amp;quot;. However, his time within the M.E.G. was cut short, as he caught sight of his wife on Level 11 by sheer miracle, who also got no-clipped by accident not long after his disappearance. Overcome with this realization, Claude decided to no longer enagage in military activities and immediately resigned from the M.E.G., determined to spend the time he had left alongside the person he loved; something he had rarely been able to do back in the Frontrooms. Tragically, the attacks of December 25 separated him from his wife forever, driving him to the lowest point of his life. Just as he was about to &lt;em&gt;end it all&lt;/em&gt;, he finally came back to his senses. In the end, he chose to sacrifice himself to protect another family who got in trouble with a Liberation patrol unit.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, this peaceful life ended after the attacks of December 25 claimed her husband’s life. She and her daughter were later rescued in extremis by a Samaritan who had endured a similar situation, sacrificing himself along the way to save them. This tragedy, combined with the loss of her husband, changed her, but ultimately for the better. In the aftermath, she joined the Resistance and quickly rose through the ranks, driven by remarkable diligence and the exceptional management skills she had once gained working for the Serbian government back in the Frontrooms; something she had originally hoped to leave behind when she found herself in the Backrooms. After the Syndicate’s victory over Liberation, she was appointed Secretary General of &amp;quot;The Overwatch&amp;quot; Security Council, with the goal of preventing any future major conflict between humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pantheon knew about Entity 77X all along. They kept this subject a secret to anyone outside the pantheon, but the current situation prompted one of them to reveal the story behind Entity 77X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Origins, the Pantheon underwent a near complete redesign from the original Pantheon lore. Indeed, in this canon, the Backrooms was created by a single God who then created several &amp;quot;Pillars&amp;quot; referred to as his direct descendants, the &amp;quot;Pillars&amp;quot; then created &amp;quot;Avatars&amp;quot; as you all know (Blanche, Argos, etc.), in order for the Pillars to use their powers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know that this is already told in the infobox but allow me to repeat that it&#039;s not the reverence main storyline. &amp;quot;Origins&amp;quot; is rather a separate storyline with original lore and canons elements. The reverence is a very interesting and underused group but I let the honor for their original writers to write their intended lore. In no circumstance I steal the GOI writing direction and ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough speaking. I hope that you enjoyed this canon!&lt;/p&gt;

However, the entity has absolutely no power or control outside its realm, and therefore relies on Liberation to carry out its wishes within the Backrooms. It is theorized that the entity can create several manifestations of itself, each with a distinct consciousness but all linked to its host. Its very existence is uncertain as nobody witnessed its physical existence; some might say that it is just a hallucination or a phenomenon. The Patriarch is the only known human to have directly communicated with this &quot;entity&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Related Pages:</strong> <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-997">Paradise 997</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-997/offset/1">Entity 997-A</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-770">Paradise 770</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-771">Paradise 771</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-771/offset/6">Revelations</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-772">Paradise 772</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-772/offset/1">Divine Elegy</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-772/offset/9">Red Dawn</a>, <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-772/offset/11">Checkmate</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><br /></p> <div class="logoblock"> <div class="bluetitle"> <h2><span><a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-771/offset/4">The Syndicate</a></span></h2> </div> <hr /> <p><em>More commonly referred to as &quot;the Resistance&quot;, the Syndicate is a coalition founded by the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens/offset/2">Masked Maidens</a>, including the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-eyes-of-argos">Eyes of Argos</a>, the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-u-e-c">U.E.C.</a>, the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-robotics">Backrooms Robotics</a>, the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-eternal-repository">Eternal Repository</a>, the <a href="https://fr-backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/cercle-ariane">Ariane Circle</a> and the remain of the <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">M.E.G.</a></em></p> <p><em>They are the last remaining opposing force to Liberation and the last hope for humanity.<br /> However, due to the severity of the situation they can't afford to play it safe.

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chapter 1: The meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-red-knight&quot;&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt; did not expect that day to be walking deep into the extended caverns of Hoofstad. He felt a strange pull that led him to supervise that area specifically. Perhaps there could be some dangerous creatures lurking around that could pose a threat to the village, or maybe a human could have gotten lost while returning from a hunting trip. That is what he finally decided to choose as his motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He briefly took his time to sharpen his sword against a rocky surface and that&#039;s when he suddenly heard a call for help. It was the voice of a woman, who was clearly panicking and afraid. Without wasting time, he ran to the source of the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;S-Stay away from me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman with dark skin, brown curly hair, and light brown eyes was frantically swinging a large stick in front of her. She was trying to fend off a large, quadrupedal creature that was trying to bite her arm off. It was rabid, angry, and probably also hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only took an instant for Claudius to annihilate the aggressive creature to nothing — just one slash of his sword turned it into pieces. Once again, he was able to save a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman he saved looked shocked from what just happened. After several seconds of silence, she looked at him with a grateful expression before throwing herself in his arms and embracing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You saved my life! I would have died if it weren&#039;t for you! Thank you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius stood very still, incapable of comprehending the purpose of an embrace. The customs of human beings have always confused him, though it felt quite nice. He has vague memories about how humans express gratefulness, but this was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is merely my duty as a warrior — to save and protect those who are innocent. You needn&#039;t to thank me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman let go of him; she now had a big smile on her face. The glimmer in her eyes suggested that she was admiring him dearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are a real knight?! That&#039;s so cool! I- I was trying to train in the caverns to become strong like one&amp;#8230; Please! Teach me your skills!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This human woman was truly odd, he thought. He never had any of those he rescued act in such a way. They often just thanked him briefly, sometimes they gave him a piece of bread or meat as a gift and went back on their merry way. Just what was this girl even thinking? Did she truly endanger herself by coming all the way there just to become a strong warrior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You could have been seriously injured, woman. The caverns are extremely dangerous when alone. You don&#039;t seem to have any hunting experience either. Do not return here on your own ever again or you could end up dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not answer her request. He wouldn&#039;t want to involve a fragile human being in a tough lifestyle. He wants to bear the burden of being the protector of all life on his own. Human beings have an already short lifespan, but adding such a tough job would only shorten it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman didn&#039;t seem to be any less determined; she accepted the scolding with an understanding chuckle. She felt like a person being lectured for having accidentally broken a precious vase, yet, she wanted to prove him wrong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am strong! I may have failed this time, but I&#039;ve been working harder to gain the courage to fight. Please! Allow me to prove myself to you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pleaded with such determination that Claudius&#039; heart almost softened for a second. However, he quickly regained his stern attitude, not wanting to risk putting her in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You risk death with the things you wish to do. You must focus on living a peaceful life, instead. The life expectancy of humans is short, becoming a warrior is also a heavy burden. I don&#039;t wish for your entire life to be known only by the countless scars that would tell of all the foes you had laid waste to; it is not a thing that you can bear without full dedication.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the perspective of the life of a warrior being described in a crude and realistic manner, the woman seemed to not be deterred at all. She instead continued to stand her ground, her eyes still had a strong fire of resolution in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to become a warrior so I can protect my village and the people around me. Do you think I don&#039;t know how tough it is to be one? Even then, despite all the hardships I will face&amp;#8230; I know that this is the path I want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be able to fight this way for the sake of others. So please, give me one chance!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius was puzzled, though, his confusion quickly turned into a brief hint of respect. He noticed her bruised and hardened fists, that probably were used all day to train, her scratched and patched-up knees that witnessed many falls for the same reason&amp;#8230; She must truly mean it, to want to become a warrior, especially if she dared to venture alone in such a dangerous place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stayed silent for a minute before he made his final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nevertheless, I will give you this opportunity to become my disciple, but you must not do something so reckless without permission ever again. Understood? From now on, you must listen to my instructions in order to not risk your life so frequently. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was now enthusiastic, she reached out for yet another embrace, which made Claudius feel strange. It was not a negative kind of oddity, but it was still quite a mystery to him. Nonetheless, he allowed her to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you! Thank you so much! I won&#039;t disappoint you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! I almost forgot! I&#039;m Shani! Please help me become your great companion! I can also teach you some things in exchange!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That marked the beginning of his new task, to train his disciple and turn her into a powerful warrior. He wondered if it would be difficult; he had never trained a human after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few days were difficult for Shani. Claudius was trying to teach her how to wield a weapon; she ended up picking a spear for herself and was able to move it pretty smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting-wise, she was learning the basics, attempting to do clean and quick attacks with the tip of her spear. She was still a beginner, but he admired her dedication. Although, she was quite clumsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani took a deep breath as she let herself sit down by a wall, she was extremely sweaty and tired since she was training with Claudius for over two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Claudius, could I have something to eat? I&#039;m very exhausted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, right, food. He had almost forgotten that human beings need nourishment to survive. He excused himself for ten minutes, then he returned with a few animals he personally hunted and skinned. Far too many, perhaps. He was carrying them all with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani gasped in enthusiastic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You did not need to hunt so many for me! One is enough to feed a family of four!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quickly started a campfire with wood and stones and, after enough attempts, started the flames. Neatly cutting some meat and placing it into a pot, she placed it above the fire to cook it. Claudius watched her cook, but he didn&#039;t help. Since it was a human thing, he&#039;d keep himself out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ooh! It already smells delicious!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius glanced at the sparkling fire, the smell of meat was not so unpleasant after all. His companion truly got excited over such little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is there a particular reason why humans need to eat?&amp;quot; He asked. He was never against learning new things from time to time; this could be helpful in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Well, we human beings digest food and turn it into energy! That is how our body functions. Water helps it stay hydrated, too. Without food, our body wouldn&#039;t be able to survive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius nodded in acknowledgment, now watching his disciple gleefully gobble up the cooked meat. He didn&#039;t think humans could eat so quickly; she truly must have been hungry. He feels guilty for not knowing about this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m full, Claudius. We can continue!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new task proved to be more intriguing than he initially thought. Since the first week he spent training and wandering with Shani, he had learned many things about human beings that were completely unknown to him before. For example, the time he learned that humans need sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened when they were on their way back from slaughtering a few pests that were devouring the resources of the humans. It was the first time the two actually ventured together on a long journey, which meant Shani did not return to her village to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Claudius, could we stop for the day? I&#039;m afraid I cannot proceed further without some rest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius stopped his marching, he turned to stare at her. His expression was obviously covered by his helmet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is sleep? Is it another human requirement for survival?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani nods rather slowly. She sat down against a big rock while shivering from the environment&#039;s cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It keeps us alive. Sleep helps to regain strength and put the body to rest…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrior in shining armor sat by her side, turning on a small fire to help her warm up. She truly seemed to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I shall let you sleep for as long as needed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani thanked him before slowly shutting her eyes and leaning against his shoulder. Soon, her quiet breathing led to a deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His armor must have been an uncomfortable place to lean her head on to sleep, so he gently moved her head to rest on a sack full of soft feathers that they were going to carry back to the village. It was probably much softer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping humans were so intriguing to observe. He never knew that they could have such peaceful looks on their faces. He wondered how relaxing it must be to be able to rest that way. Despite that, he knew he had to stay on guard and make sure to watch her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that same journey, he learned that humans suffer in extremely cold temperatures. He took note of that and brought a warm fur coat for her to wear in future missions. It surprisingly worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point in time, Shani completely learned the basics of spear fighting and dodging. Her movements were like elegant dancing. He never thought fighting could be elegant, or graceful since his own way of fighting was crude and blunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Focus, Shani, observe the way I move. This is the first time you directly challenge me, so pay attention.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This battle was far more different than any other he had. The training grounds he usually used felt more radiant somehow. He felt a true burning excitement and anticipation for what was about to come. Only Shani was ever able to create such feelings in his heart. She was an opponent that he truly enjoyed challenging, even if she was just a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani held onto her red-coated spear with a determined gaze. Claudius restrained his strength to the minimum in order to not harm her. He slowly attacked her with his sword. However, to her, it still felt like the hit of a powerful giant. She was able to block with the shield she held in her other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her companion retaliated, attacking with a more decisive slash. She counterattacked with her spear; it almost managed to hit him. This back-and-forth proceeded for the following twenty minutes, until Shani was able to connect with her spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exact act made the two turn entirely silent. It felt like there were no other distractions or things around them. It was just Shani, Claudius, and their battle. It took a while for Claudius to break the silence, after his initial surprise. He disarmed her soon after, since she was distracted by the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Great job, it&#039;s the first time you&#039;ve managed to hit me. You are learning extremely diligently.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani lit up as she heard his words, cheering on the spot before she hugged him. He had gotten used to it at that point, it was a daily occurrence. For the first time, he focused more on the hug, observing her more than usual. She had a slight scent of herbs and wood that lingered around her—something he hadn&#039;t noticed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m so glad that I came this far! It&#039;s all thanks to you! You&#039;re the best companion I could ever have!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She let go of him just as quickly as she hugged him. She then started running around happily, probably to let off some steam while also expressing her enthusiasm. Claudius found it quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped running around after a while. She sat by his side with a more serious look now. She wanted to show him that she was professional and ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does this mean you&#039;ll bring me to fight by your side in more dangerous missions? I want to help!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question once again caught him off guard; he did not expect her to want to take a step further and perform such a difficult task. So far, she only helped the village people by eliminating smaller threats, but she now desired to face the same foes he had been carefully handling for decades? He was concerned that she may get hurt. However, letting her watch him would be a new learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You won&#039;t fight with me, but you can observe me fighting a more difficult foe, yes. That would help you learn many new tactics. Just promise you will not be reckless about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I swear on my life! I will wait safely until you have finished!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was being truthful, so he felt somewhat relieved. He wanted to see that she was capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was settled. At the start of the following week, Claudius and Shani ventured to a distant level. It had a few scattered villages that were being plagued by a &amp;quot;beast&amp;quot; hiding in the desert sand. The beast had already taken quite a few victims, but it was time for its reign of terror to end, at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports confirmed that it lived inside of a vast temple, deep into the desert. Its camouflage abilities allowed it to move undisturbed through the sand, and it possessed limbs that would stretch to abnormal lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How much longer will we need to walk? Are we close?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani was carefully following the warrior, she liked to observe the soft sand moving under their feet as they walked on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are almost there, Shani. It will be dark; light up the torch you brought along.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quickly lit up the fire on the torch and then handed it to Claudius. He held it steadily and stopped at the entrance of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You must stay behind me at all times. If I tell you to hide, you hide. If I tell you to stop and wait, you do that. Understood?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani looked at him and then she solemnly nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happens if you get hurt and disarmed? Will you allow me to help you then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius did not answer her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I said what I said, Shani.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could never happen, for he was war itself. War can never be defeated so easily, no matter how dangerous and unpredictable the foe is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ventured into the temple. It smelled of blood and minerals. The dimly lit torch was able to help them figure out their surroundings. The rooms would be spacious and oddly empty&amp;#8230; if it weren&#039;t for the skeletons lying around, scattered like rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reached the entrance of another room; Claudius could sense that the beast was nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stay here and do not come in. I&#039;ll slay the beast while you learn my tactics.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Understood. Just please, be safe!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the mighty warrior entered the beast&#039;s lair. He could faintly notice it slithering on the sandy terrain. It almost looked invisible and it was very large. It was almost translucent upon sight, perfectly blending in with the background. There was no sound that could be heard in that room. How could there be? It was a deadly assassin that lurked in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reveal yourself, serpent of doom.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He unleashed his sword and began a bloody fight. The creature was now uncontrollably moving all around the room&#039;s walls, its limbs distorting and stretching to try and squeeze him to death. Claudius promptly attempted to slice at it, but it was difficult to do so since the creature was so quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each hit only led to the creature&#039;s retaliation. He was sturdy, but being tossed and thrown by the creature was making him grow weaker. It was far too fast to deal any significant damage at first. It took at least a good hour to wear it down slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not recall how much time had passed. He only knew that he had been brutally fighting the beast for a very long time. It was weakened. Soon, it would fall and die. That&#039;s what he believed until he noticed that Shani seemed to be preoccupied with fending off a few creatures that crept up on her. He did not think that they&#039;d come out while the beast was present&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen to her? He could not supervise her while he was fighting. She risked to get severely injured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trail of thought betrayed him. His distraction was enough to warrant a painful attack that threw him right at the opposite wall. He then fell, attempting to regain his bearings as he did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;CLAUDIUS!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is when Shani, after eliminating the pests that were bothering her, rushed to defend him from an upcoming attack with her shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHANI! GET OUT OF HERE!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, if Shani hadn&#039;t defended him there, he would have gotten seriously hurt. However, now she was at risk of getting brutally attacked, his worries came to fruition. The beast managed to grab Shani and squeeze her with its sharp lower body. She screamed in pain before Claudius tossed a large rock at it to distract it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was dropped to the ground; blood was oozing from her stomach. She soon fell unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudius now could not even think properly. The sight of an injured Shani made his entire mind blow up. How dare that beast to harm her? That was all it took for him to lose it. The immense heartache and rage took over him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His body grew at an abnormal rate, full of newfound strength and rage. Rage, the greatest source that powers war&amp;#8230; He lunged at the creature and began tearing it to pieces with his sword. Brutally stabbing it and hitting it with his hardened fists. The serpent tried relentlessly to get him off its body, but its fate was sealed. No amount of tossing and turning could stop his rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was over. He was back the normal, and the wretched thing was dead. He tore it to pieces, there was nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, he needed to check on Shani. He rushed to her side and held her close while checking her vitals. Her wound was not mortal and so, he utilized a few herbs and bandages that she had brought with her to treat the wound. Once the blood stopped dripping, he took a breath of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re a reckless woman, Shani&amp;#8230; You could have died.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His tone softened. He truly felt fear when he saw her hurt. The first time he ever experienced such a powerful emotion; he could not describe it. Was this the kind of attachment that humans always spoke about? He did not know yet, he would never admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hands lightly ran through her hair, although, they retreated quite quickly. He opted to merely continue holding her close. He reasoned it was solely for the purpose of guarding her properly. Shani&#039;s breathing was now stable, she seemed to search for his warmth in her unconscious state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He brought her outside, then set up a campfire to sit nearby. It was starting to become cold, so he needed to make sure to keep her temperature stable, while he did so, he observed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds of silence, he removed his helmet carefully and placed it to the side. His face remained obscured, but that did not matter. He lightly pressed his forehead against her head, it only lasted a few seconds, but he needed to calm his fear in some way or another. He could not feel if she was warm any other way, he reasoned, heat would not pass through the armor. That act put his heart at peace at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#039;t have the heart to scold her when she would eventually wake up. He was too focused on her fragility as a human, so he would put that aside to focus on her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed. This woman managed to throw his brain and heart into a panic. Yet.. he did not dislike it. His heart felt oddly warm as he held her, a kind of warmth that only familiarity could produce. He allowed himself to close his eyes as he relaxed thanks to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

He felt a strange pull that led him to supervise that area specifically. Perhaps there could be some dangerous creatures lurking around that could pose a threat to the village, or maybe a human could have gotten lost while returning from a hunting trip. That is what he finally decided to choose as his motivation.</p> <p>He briefly took his time to sharpen his sword against a rocky surface and that's when he suddenly heard a call for help. It was the voice of a woman, who was clearly panicking and afraid. Without wasting time, he ran to the source of the voice.</p> <p>&quot;S-Stay away from me!&quot;</p> <p>A woman with dark skin, brown curly hair, and light brown eyes was frantically swinging a large stick in front of her. She was trying to fend off a large, quadrupedal creature that was trying to bite her arm off. It was rabid, angry, and probably also hungry.</p> <p>It only took an instant for Claudius to annihilate the aggressive creature to nothing — just one slash of his sword turned it into pieces. Once again, he was able to save a life.</p> <p>The woman he saved looked shocked from what just happened. After several seconds of silence, she looked at him with a grateful expression before throwing herself in his arms and embracing him.</p> <p>&quot;You saved my life! I would have died if it weren't for you! Thank you!&quot;</p> <p>Claudius stood very still, incapable of comprehending the purpose of an embrace. The customs of human beings have always confused him, though it felt quite nice. He has vague memories about how humans express gratefulness, but this was new.</p> <p>&quot;It is merely my duty as a warrior — to save and protect those who are innocent. You needn't to thank me.&quot;</p> <p>The woman let go of him; she now had a big smile on her face. The glimmer in her eyes suggested that she was admiring him dearly.</p> <p>&quot;You are a real knight?! That's so cool! I- I was trying to train in the caverns to become strong like one&#8230; Please! Teach me your skills!&quot;</p> <p>This human woman was truly odd, he thought. He never had any of those he rescued act in such a way. They often just thanked him briefly, sometimes they gave him a piece of bread or meat as a gift and went back on their merry way. Just what was this girl even thinking? Did she truly endanger herself by coming all the way there just to become a strong warrior?</p> <p>&quot;You could have been seriously injured, woman. The caverns are extremely dangerous when alone. You don't seem to have any hunting experience either. Do not return here on your own ever again or you could end up dead.&quot;</p> <p>He did not answer her request. He wouldn't want to involve a fragile human being in a tough lifestyle. He wants to bear the burden of being the protector of all life on his own. Human beings have an already short lifespan, but adding such a tough job would only shorten it further.</p> <p>The woman didn't seem to be any less determined; she accepted the scolding with an understanding chuckle. She felt like a person being lectured for having accidentally broken a precious vase, yet, she wanted to prove him wrong,</p> <p>&quot;I am strong! I may have failed this time, but I've been working harder to gain the courage to fight. Please! Allow me to prove myself to you!&quot;</p> <p>She pleaded with such determination that Claudius' heart almost softened for a second. However, he quickly regained his stern attitude, not wanting to risk putting her in danger.</p> <p>&quot;You risk death with the things you wish to do. You must focus on living a peaceful life, instead. The life expectancy of humans is short, becoming a warrior is also a heavy burden. I don't wish for your entire life to be known only by the countless scars that would tell of all the foes you had laid waste to; it is not a thing that you can bear without full dedication.&quot;</p> <p>Even with the perspective of the life of a warrior being described in a crude and realistic manner, the woman seemed to not be deterred at all. She instead continued to stand her ground, her eyes still had a strong fire of resolution in them.</p> <p>&quot;I want to become a warrior so I can protect my village and the people around me. Do you think I don't know how tough it is to be one? Even then, despite all the hardships I will face&#8230; I know that this is the path I want to follow.</p> <p>Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be able to fight this way for the sake of others. So please, give me one chance!&quot;</p> <p>Claudius was puzzled, though, his confusion quickly turned into a brief hint of respect. He noticed her bruised and hardened fists, that probably were used all day to train, her scratched and patched-up knees that witnessed many falls for the same reason&#8230; She must truly mean it, to want to become a warrior, especially if she dared to venture alone in such a dangerous place.</p> <p>He stayed silent for a minute before he made his final decision.</p> <p>&quot;Nevertheless, I will give you this opportunity to become my disciple, but you must not do something so reckless without permission ever again. Understood? From now on, you must listen to my instructions in order to not risk your life so frequently. &quot;</p> <p>She was now enthusiastic, she reached out for yet another embrace, which made Claudius feel strange. It was not a negative kind of oddity, but it was still quite a mystery to him. Nonetheless, he allowed her to do so.</p> <p>&quot;Thank you! Thank you so much! I won't disappoint you!</p> <p>Ah! I almost forgot! I'm Shani! Please help me become your great companion! I can also teach you some things in exchange!&quot;</p> <p>That marked the beginning of his new task, to train his disciple and turn her into a powerful warrior. He wondered if it would be difficult; he had never trained a human after all.</p> <p>The first few days were difficult for Shani. Claudius was trying to teach her how to wield a weapon; she ended up picking a spear for herself and was able to move it pretty smoothly.</p> <p>Fighting-wise, she was learning the basics, attempting to do clean and quick attacks with the tip of her spear. She was still a beginner, but he admired her dedication. Although, she was quite clumsy.</p> <p>Shani took a deep breath as she let herself sit down by a wall, she was extremely sweaty and tired since she was training with Claudius for over two hours.</p> <p>&quot;Claudius, could I have something to eat? I'm very exhausted.&quot;</p> <p>Ah, right, food. He had almost forgotten that human beings need nourishment to survive. He excused himself for ten minutes, then he returned with a few animals he personally hunted and skinned. Far too many, perhaps. He was carrying them all with ease.</p> <p>Shani gasped in enthusiastic shock.</p> <p>&quot;You did not need to hunt so many for me! One is enough to feed a family of four!&quot;</p> <p>She quickly started a campfire with wood and stones and, after enough attempts, started the flames. Neatly cutting some meat and placing it into a pot, she placed it above the fire to cook it. Claudius watched her cook, but he didn't help. Since it was a human thing, he'd keep himself out of it.</p> <p>&quot;Ooh! It already smells delicious!&quot;</p> <p>Claudius glanced at the sparkling fire, the smell of meat was not so unpleasant after all. His companion truly got excited over such little things.</p> <p>&quot;Is there a particular reason why humans need to eat?&quot; He asked. He was never against learning new things from time to time; this could be helpful in the long run.</p> <p>&quot;Oh! Well, we human beings digest food and turn it into energy! That is how our body functions. Water helps it stay hydrated, too. Without food, our body wouldn't be able to survive.&quot;</p> <p>Claudius nodded in acknowledgment, now watching his disciple gleefully gobble up the cooked meat. He didn't think humans could eat so quickly; she truly must have been hungry. He feels guilty for not knowing about this earlier.</p> <p>&quot;I'm full, Claudius. We can continue!&quot;</p> <p>This new task proved to be more intriguing than he initially thought. Since the first week he spent training and wandering with Shani, he had learned many things about human beings that were completely unknown to him before. For example, the time he learned that humans need sleep.</p> <p>It happened when they were on their way back from slaughtering a few pests that were devouring the resources of the humans. It was the first time the two actually ventured together on a long journey, which meant Shani did not return to her village to sleep.</p> <p>&quot;Claudius, could we stop for the day? I'm afraid I cannot proceed further without some rest.&quot;</p> <p>Claudius stopped his marching, he turned to stare at her. His expression was obviously covered by his helmet</p> <p>&quot;What is sleep? Is it another human requirement for survival?&quot;</p> <p>Shani nods rather slowly. She sat down against a big rock while shivering from the environment's cold.</p> <p>&quot;It keeps us alive. Sleep helps to regain strength and put the body to rest…&quot;</p> <p>The warrior in shining armor sat by her side, turning on a small fire to help her warm up. She truly seemed to appreciate it.</p> <p>&quot;Then I shall let you sleep for as long as needed.&quot;</p> <p>Shani thanked him before slowly shutting her eyes and leaning against his shoulder. Soon, her quiet breathing led to a deep sleep.</p> <p>His armor must have been an uncomfortable place to lean her head on to sleep, so he gently moved her head to rest on a sack full of soft feathers that they were going to carry back to the village. It was probably much softer.</p> <p>Sleeping humans were so intriguing to observe. He never knew that they could have such peaceful looks on their faces. He wondered how relaxing it must be to be able to rest that way. Despite that, he knew he had to stay on guard and make sure to watch her back.</p> <p>From that same journey, he learned that humans suffer in extremely cold temperatures. He took note of that and brought a warm fur coat for her to wear in future missions. It surprisingly worked.</p> <p>At a certain point in time, Shani completely learned the basics of spear fighting and dodging. Her movements were like elegant dancing. He never thought fighting could be elegant, or graceful since his own way of fighting was crude and blunt.</p> <p>&quot;Focus, Shani, observe the way I move. This is the first time you directly challenge me, so pay attention.&quot;</p> <p>This battle was far more different than any other he had. The training grounds he usually used felt more radiant somehow. He felt a true burning excitement and anticipation for what was about to come. Only Shani was ever able to create such feelings in his heart. She was an opponent that he truly enjoyed challenging, even if she was just a human being.</p> <p>Shani held onto her red-coated spear with a determined gaze. Claudius restrained his strength to the minimum in order to not harm her. He slowly attacked her with his sword. However, to her, it still felt like the hit of a powerful giant. She was able to block with the shield she held in her other hand.</p> <p>Her companion retaliated, attacking with a more decisive slash. She counterattacked with her spear; it almost managed to hit him. This back-and-forth proceeded for the following twenty minutes, until Shani was able to connect with her spear.</p> <p>That exact act made the two turn entirely silent. It felt like there were no other distractions or things around them. It was just Shani, Claudius, and their battle. It took a while for Claudius to break the silence, after his initial surprise. He disarmed her soon after, since she was distracted by the moment.</p> <p>&quot;Great job, it's the first time you've managed to hit me. You are learning extremely diligently.&quot;</p> <p>Shani lit up as she heard his words, cheering on the spot before she hugged him. He had gotten used to it at that point, it was a daily occurrence. For the first time, he focused more on the hug, observing her more than usual. She had a slight scent of herbs and wood that lingered around her—something he hadn't noticed in the past.</p> <p>&quot;I'm so glad that I came this far! It's all thanks to you! You're the best companion I could ever have!&quot;</p> <p>She let go of him just as quickly as she hugged him. She then started running around happily, probably to let off some steam while also expressing her enthusiasm. Claudius found it quite amusing.</p> <p>She stopped running around after a while. She sat by his side with a more serious look now. She wanted to show him that she was professional and ready.</p> <p>&quot;Does this mean you'll bring me to fight by your side in more dangerous missions? I want to help!&quot;</p> <p>That question once again caught him off guard; he did not expect her to want to take a step further and perform such a difficult task. So far, she only helped the village people by eliminating smaller threats, but she now desired to face the same foes he had been carefully handling for decades? He was concerned that she may get hurt. However, letting her watch him would be a new learning experience.</p> <p>&quot;You won't fight with me, but you can observe me fighting a more difficult foe, yes. That would help you learn many new tactics. Just promise you will not be reckless about it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I swear on my life! I will wait safely until you have finished!&quot;</p> <p>She was being truthful, so he felt somewhat relieved. He wanted to see that she was capable.</p> <p>The deal was settled. At the start of the following week, Claudius and Shani ventured to a distant level. It had a few scattered villages that were being plagued by a &quot;beast&quot; hiding in the desert sand. The beast had already taken quite a few victims, but it was time for its reign of terror to end, at last.</p> <p>Reports confirmed that it lived inside of a vast temple, deep into the desert. Its camouflage abilities allowed it to move undisturbed through the sand, and it possessed limbs that would stretch to abnormal lengths.</p> <p>&quot;How much longer will we need to walk? Are we close?&quot;</p> <p>Shani was carefully following the warrior, she liked to observe the soft sand moving under their feet as they walked on it.</p> <p>&quot;We are almost there, Shani. It will be dark; light up the torch you brought along.&quot;</p> <p>She quickly lit up the fire on the torch and then handed it to Claudius. He held it steadily and stopped at the entrance of the temple.</p> <p>&quot;You must stay behind me at all times. If I tell you to hide, you hide. If I tell you to stop and wait, you do that. Understood?&quot;</p> <p>Shani looked at him and then she solemnly nodded.</p> <p>&quot;What happens if you get hurt and disarmed? Will you allow me to help you then?&quot;</p> <p>Claudius did not answer her.</p> <p>&quot;I said what I said, Shani.&quot;</p> <p>It could never happen, for he was war itself. War can never be defeated so easily, no matter how dangerous and unpredictable the foe is.</p> <p>The two ventured into the temple. It smelled of blood and minerals. The dimly lit torch was able to help them figure out their surroundings. The rooms would be spacious and oddly empty&#8230; if it weren't for the skeletons lying around, scattered like rocks.</p> <p>They reached the entrance of another room; Claudius could sense that the beast was nearby.</p> <p>&quot;Stay here and do not come in. I'll slay the beast while you learn my tactics.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Understood. Just please, be safe!&quot;</p> <p>With that, the mighty warrior entered the beast's lair. He could faintly notice it slithering on the sandy terrain. It almost looked invisible and it was very large. It was almost translucent upon sight, perfectly blending in with the background. There was no sound that could be heard in that room. How could there be? It was a deadly assassin that lurked in the shadows.</p> <p>&quot;Reveal yourself, serpent of doom.&quot;</p> <p>He unleashed his sword and began a bloody fight. The creature was now uncontrollably moving all around the room's walls, its limbs distorting and stretching to try and squeeze him to death. Claudius promptly attempted to slice at it, but it was difficult to do so since the creature was so quick.</p> <p>Each hit only led to the creature's retaliation. He was sturdy, but being tossed and thrown by the creature was making him grow weaker. It was far too fast to deal any significant damage at first. It took at least a good hour to wear it down slowly.</p> <p>He could not recall how much time had passed. He only knew that he had been brutally fighting the beast for a very long time. It was weakened. Soon, it would fall and die. That's what he believed until he noticed that Shani seemed to be preoccupied with fending off a few creatures that crept up on her. He did not think that they'd come out while the beast was present&#8230;</p> <p>What will happen to her? He could not supervise her while he was fighting. She risked to get severely injured!</p> <p>That trail of thought betrayed him. His distraction was enough to warrant a painful attack that threw him right at the opposite wall. He then fell, attempting to regain his bearings as he did so.</p> <p>&quot;CLAUDIUS!&quot;</p> <p>That is when Shani, after eliminating the pests that were bothering her, rushed to defend him from an upcoming attack with her shield.</p> <p>&quot;SHANI! GET OUT OF HERE!&quot;</p> <p>Truth be told, if Shani hadn't defended him there, he would have gotten seriously hurt. However, now she was at risk of getting brutally attacked, his worries came to fruition. The beast managed to grab Shani and squeeze her with its sharp lower body. She screamed in pain before Claudius tossed a large rock at it to distract it.</p> <p>She was dropped to the ground; blood was oozing from her stomach. She soon fell unconscious.</p> <p>Claudius now could not even think properly. The sight of an injured Shani made his entire mind blow up. How dare that beast to harm her? That was all it took for him to lose it. The immense heartache and rage took over him.</p> <p>His body grew at an abnormal rate, full of newfound strength and rage. Rage, the greatest source that powers war&#8230; He lunged at the creature and began tearing it to pieces with his sword. Brutally stabbing it and hitting it with his hardened fists. The serpent tried relentlessly to get him off its body, but its fate was sealed. No amount of tossing and turning could stop his rage.</p> <p>Then it was over. He was back the normal, and the wretched thing was dead. He tore it to pieces, there was nothing left.</p> <p>Now, he needed to check on Shani. He rushed to her side and held her close while checking her vitals. Her wound was not mortal and so, he utilized a few herbs and bandages that she had brought with her to treat the wound. Once the blood stopped dripping, he took a breath of relief.</p> <p>&quot;You're a reckless woman, Shani&#8230; You could have died.&quot;</p> <p>His tone softened. He truly felt fear when he saw her hurt. The first time he ever experienced such a powerful emotion; he could not describe it. Was this the kind of attachment that humans always spoke about? He did not know yet, he would never admit it.</p> <p>His hands lightly ran through her hair, although, they retreated quite quickly. He opted to merely continue holding her close. He reasoned it was solely for the purpose of guarding her properly. Shani's breathing was now stable, she seemed to search for his warmth in her unconscious state.</p> <p>He brought her outside, then set up a campfire to sit nearby. It was starting to become cold, so he needed to make sure to keep her temperature stable, while he did so, he observed her.</p> <p>After a few seconds of silence, he removed his helmet carefully and placed it to the side. His face remained obscured, but that did not matter. He lightly pressed his forehead against her head, it only lasted a few seconds, but he needed to calm his fear in some way or another. He could not feel if she was warm any other way, he reasoned, heat would not pass through the armor. That act put his heart at peace at least.</p> <p>He didn't have the heart to scold her when she would eventually wake up. He was too focused on her fragility as a human, so he would put that aside to focus on her recovery.</p> <p>He sighed. This woman managed to throw his brain and heart into a panic. Yet.. he did not dislike it. His heart felt oddly warm as he held her, a kind of warmth that only familiarity could produce. He allowed himself to close his eyes as he relaxed thanks to it.</p> </div> </div> <br /> <br /> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; The meeting | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/work-in-progress">Work in progress</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8144627&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713087" alt="Nikuchan " style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8144627)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nikuchan" >Nikuchan</a></span></p>

&lt;p&gt;Within the cosmic levels of the Backrooms (&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-217&quot;&gt;217&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-599&quot;&gt;599&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-296&quot;&gt;level-296&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), wanderers may encounter &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; — otherwise known as “Solaris.” &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; is identified by her humanoid shape and a varying stature, noted to depend on environmental factors. Observed from afar In her &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; state, she is most commonly observed to be the size of an average red giant star, though she can proportionate her size to that of whatever she is interacting with if necessary. Regardless of her given size, &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; notably possesses a muscular physique, long hair mirroring the image of the night sky, and appears to wear darkly-colored dense armor plating around her body. Currently, the material from which this armor is crafted is unidentifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;science&lt;/span&gt;Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; has eyes with adaptable pupils that can acclimate to extreme darkness, and has extraordinary senses capable of detecting electromagnetic waves (as evidenced by her ability to detect uniquely unstable celestial bodies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; possesses a vast array of capabilities, notably demolishing celestial bodies and tearing through the fabric of space within her levels; the latter is theorized to result in blips. The purpose of these capabilities is twofold: to sustain the core embedded in the center of the entity’s chest (from which she draws power) via engulfing matter and to maintain the stability of her native levels by disposing of decayed, disorderly, unstable, or defective celestial mass. The primary means by which she accomplishes this is a blade, which she materializes from her hand as an orbit of fluid matter surrounding a black hole in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-center&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/space-lady-by-soleste/SolarisSword.png&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:80%; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artistic rendition of the entity&#039;s aforementioned sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, throughout the demolition process, small black holes will erratically form around &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt;, further aiding her in absorbing and eliminating debris. There is a certain limit to how much matter the entity can consume and use, as too much exertion or consumption can cause the black holes around her to instead feed off of her own matter. With the exception of her blade and the environmental effects resulting from her destructive state (see Behaviors), &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt;’s powers curiously do not seem to directly affect other lifeforms, even within close range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, such magnitudes of destruction have not occurred outside &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt;’s native levels. Although it may be possible for her to leave her levels, there have not been any recently reported sightings outside them. This may be attributed to the entity&#039;s wish to distance herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;psychology&lt;/span&gt;Behaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; is often ambivalent towards wanderers, though occasional unpredictability is to be expected in her actions. The entity exhibits irritability towards those interacting with her, but also remorse for any potential harm caused. Although there have been incidents in which lives were lost as a result of disturbing her, it appears that an effort is being made by her to avoid contact with others altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; has been observed to have three discernible primary states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the default state of the entity, in which she is considered to be most stable and tranquil. While in this state, she is relatively passive and neutral, though little information is available to quantify the full extent of her demeanor, as this is her most infrequent state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destructive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as the “working” state, it is the period in which &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; busies herself with feeding on celestial bodies. Focus is required to properly complete the process without damaging the rest of the level. During this state, the entity’s cataclysmic powers are at their strongest and most active. Due to her heightened volatility during this phase, any interaction may inadvertently provoke a harmful response from the entity. Additionally, explosions and debris create a hazardous and non-navigable environment for wanderers. As such, it is strongly advised to not disturb &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; during this state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dormant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/space-lady-by-soleste/SolarisStasis.png&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketch of &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; in her dormant state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consuming the maximum threshold of energy, &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; will enter stasis. This is a critical resting period observed after the entity&#039;s destructive state has passed, as the black holes around her may multiply and consume her if she does not remain idle. Although the entity may appear to be in a deep sleep, she remains conscious and aware of her surroundings. Interestingly, &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; will assume partial camouflage by surrounding herself with her own hair (see attached illustration), acting as both a shield and a cover while resting. In this state of alert hibernation, any disturbance may result in hostility. As with the destructive state, it is strongly advised to not disturb &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; while it is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;Relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-52&quot;&gt;Null-06&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; appears to be wary of Null-06, finding its destructive nature to be an unnatural upset to the balance of the levels she oversees. Besides working to hold Null-06 at bay and prevent its damage from becoming too widespread, there may also be a potential history shared between the two entities— as evidenced by the unease &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; expresses in reaction to mentions of Null-06, and the nature of their observed interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-404&quot;&gt;Entity 404&lt;/a&gt;: As opposed to Null-06, &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; appeared to have had a positive connection with Entity 404— possibly even to the extent of a “friendship”. She was observed to mourn the loss of Entity 404 in the wake of its consumption by Null-06, which is likely a prominent factor in her rivalry with the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-599&quot;&gt;Aster&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; fondly regards Aster, whom she met following Entity 404’s demise. Aster appears to assist &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; in filling the void left by Entity 404, attempting to form a similar bond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt; is believed to have existed in the Backrooms for at least as long as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-1&quot;&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; have inhabited it. The Lost have a plethora of myths and legends about “Solaris, the Starmother”; a &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:phenomenon-10&quot;&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon&quot;&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt; who maintained the heavens by consuming celestial bodies, keeping them in order. This was not perceived negatively, but rather as a necessary function of the universe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/leo-castellos&quot;&gt;Leo Castellos&lt;/a&gt;, a surviving ancient member of The Lost, has corroborated the identity of Solaris with that of &lt;strong&gt;Entity 700&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;nebulablock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of zero-gravity stillness, your form shifts. Your hair follows every movement of your body as it drifts amidst the aether. You open your eyes, sharp slits faintly glowing among the endless hues of dark purples and blues. In order to take in more light, they dilate, reflecting what little planetary warmth surrounds your being. How long has it been since you have rested, static and stagnant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any celestial body, it starts with a core— a burning, radiant sun illuminating its perimeter so vastly that it had almost been deterring to gaze at. Mortal eyes do not see beyond its light, to detect the consciousness that had awakened within it. It too did not yet know it was alive until it started to &lt;em&gt;starve&lt;/em&gt;, and when it starved, it brought everything within its gravitational pull to drive it to a flaming end. It devoured what stardust it could, until it became so bright that it started to consume itself within a beaming vortex of clashing void and flame. In its desperation to end its self-cannibalization, it fell into a dormant slumber. Unbeknownst to it, it formed itself a body as the planetary heavens around it shifted, and shifted again until it had awoken to find itself in an abandoned pocket of space, and in that moment it &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:phenomenon-10&quot;&gt;knew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
You gaze upon your sharp-tipped claws and feel the power in them. You look upon your surroundings with a sense of longing you cannot explain&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-1&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You destroyed so much to live for so little, to dedicate your purpose to cleansing a domain that was not even within your control. You think back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/ad-astra&quot;&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt;, and you&#039;re filled with the same hopelessness that once washed over you when you &lt;em&gt;failed your purpose&lt;/em&gt;. But O&#039; Solaris, you still survived amongst the confines of this realm, you still watch over it diligently as you&#039;ve always had, haven&#039;t you? You hold within you the grand force of cataclysm; it lay between your claws and beneath your layers of armor; it streams through your ichor and into your blade. Your hair, now, is clutched between your trembling hands. Though its ability to reflect the celestial skies once brought you visions of movement and flashes of flaring color, it is now dull and mirrors only the faint, dull specks of light far away, just like how empty it is here now&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-2&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You think back to when you caught glimpses of people staring at you with eyes full of starlit wonder as you worked, and how you dismissed them harshly. How you had dismissed them by your blade. You remember the petrified, small figures scattered across stations and debris, you remember how they cowered in fear at the sight of you. You had been burdened with such an overwhelming and unforgiving task that you had discarded any potential to be worshiped like the rest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon&quot;&gt;your siblings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-3&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. No, you never thought that such things were important, that they were any more crucial to you than your need for survival and the maintenance of this home you hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet now, more than ever, you regret it with all of your core&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-4&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It feels so lonesome here, alone and abandoned, &lt;em&gt;forgotten.&lt;/em&gt; There was only &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-keymaster/offset/2&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; who truly understood you, who made you feel loved, but even he is long gone; a mere shadow of his former self. Now you wish to see faces of wonder, now you wish for once to feel recognized and revered- to stand proudly with your blade to the ground- a promise that you would no longer harm. As your thoughts spiral into what could have been, you feel your body ache. Your shoulders sag from carrying such weight- your lips never once upturned to a smile. Your arms shake and you continue to gaze into the claws clutching your hair, the same claws that once crushed stardust beneath them as you watched its remains attempt to escape your grasp. A god is not supposed to feel so &lt;em&gt;weak,&lt;/em&gt; not supposed to feel so &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt;, you think&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-5&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Had you the power to create, you would be revered. You would not be here, feeding off of cataclysm to survive. You resembled an old potency of decimation, body built with the sturdiness of asteroids and planetary blood, eyes akin to a black hole and hair like a cloak of night torn from the sky. Yet you did not succeed. You did not redeem yourself, did you, &lt;em&gt;O&#039; great Solaris?&lt;/em&gt; You chose to lay here and rot alongside all the celestial bodies you&#039;ve disposed of, with no one to mourn you&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-73601-6&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A grand goddess made pitiful with power that yet remains to be properly used&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-73601-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. You made your bed and you must lie in it.&lt;/div&gt;

Observed from afar In her &quot;natural&quot; state, she is most commonly observed to be the size of an average red giant star, though she can proportionate her size to that of whatever she is interacting with if necessary. Regardless of her given size, <strong>Entity 700</strong> notably possesses a muscular physique, long hair mirroring the image of the night sky, and appears to wear darkly-colored dense armor plating around her body. Currently, the material from which this armor is crafted is unidentifiable.</p> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">science</span>Biology</span></h2> <p><strong>Entity 700</strong> has eyes with adaptable pupils that can acclimate to extreme darkness, and has extraordinary senses capable of detecting electromagnetic waves (as evidenced by her ability to detect uniquely unstable celestial bodies).</p> <p><strong>Entity 700</strong> possesses a vast array of capabilities, notably demolishing celestial bodies and tearing through the fabric of space within her levels; the latter is theorized to result in blips. The purpose of these capabilities is twofold: to sustain the core embedded in the center of the entity’s chest (from which she draws power) via engulfing matter and to maintain the stability of her native levels by disposing of decayed, disorderly, unstable, or defective celestial mass. The primary means by which she accomplishes this is a blade, which she materializes from her hand as an orbit of fluid matter surrounding a black hole in the center.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:80%;"><img src="http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/space-lady-by-soleste/SolarisSword.png" style="width:80%;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:80%; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>An artistic rendition of the entity's aforementioned sword.</p> </div> </div> <p>Furthermore, throughout the demolition process, small black holes will erratically form around <strong>Entity 700</strong>, further aiding her in absorbing and eliminating debris. There is a certain limit to how much matter the entity can consume and use, as too much exertion or consumption can cause the black holes around her to instead feed off of her own matter. With the exception of her blade and the environmental effects resulting from her destructive state (see Behaviors), <strong>Entity 700</strong>’s powers curiously do not seem to directly affect other lifeforms, even within close range.</p> <p>Fortunately, such magnitudes of destruction have not occurred outside <strong>Entity 700</strong>’s native levels. Although it may be possible for her to leave her levels, there have not been any recently reported sightings outside them. This may be attributed to the entity's wish to distance herself.</p> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">psychology</span>Behaviors</span></h2> <p><strong>Entity 700</strong> is often ambivalent towards wanderers, though occasional unpredictability is to be expected in her actions. The entity exhibits irritability towards those interacting with her, but also remorse for any potential harm caused. Although there have been incidents in which lives were lost as a result of disturbing her, it appears that an effort is being made by her to avoid contact with others altogether.</p> <p><strong>Entity 700</strong> has been observed to have three discernible primary states:</p> <h3><span><strong>Active</strong></span></h3> <p>This is the default state of the entity, in which she is considered to be most stable and tranquil. While in this state, she is relatively passive and neutral, though little information is available to quantify the full extent of her demeanor, as this is her most infrequent state.</p> <h3><span><strong>Destructive</strong></span></h3> <p>Also known as the “working” state, it is the period in which <strong>Entity 700</strong> busies herself with feeding on celestial bodies. Focus is required to properly complete the process without damaging the rest of the level. During this state, the entity’s cataclysmic powers are at their strongest and most active. Due to her heightened volatility during this phase, any interaction may inadvertently provoke a harmful response from the entity. Additionally, explosions and debris create a hazardous and non-navigable environment for wanderers. As such, it is strongly advised to not disturb <strong>Entity 700</strong> during this state.</p> <h3><span><strong>Dormant</strong></span></h3> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/space-lady-by-soleste/SolarisStasis.png" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Sketch of <strong>Entity 700</strong> in her dormant state.</p> </div> </div> <p>After consuming the maximum threshold of energy, <strong>Entity 700</strong> will enter stasis. This is a critical resting period observed after the entity's destructive state has passed, as the black holes around her may multiply and consume her if she does not remain idle. Although the entity may appear to be in a deep sleep, she remains conscious and aware of her surroundings. Interestingly, <strong>Entity 700</strong> will assume partial camouflage by surrounding herself with her own hair (see attached illustration), acting as both a shield and a cover while resting. In this state of alert hibernation, any disturbance may result in hostility. As with the destructive state, it is strongly advised to not disturb <strong>Entity 700</strong> while it is ongoing.</p> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">group</span>Relations</span></h2> <ul> <li><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-52">Null-06</a>: <strong>Entity 700</strong> appears to be wary of Null-06, finding its destructive nature to be an unnatural upset to the balance of the levels she oversees. Besides working to hold Null-06 at bay and prevent its damage from becoming too widespread, there may also be a potential history shared between the two entities— as evidenced by the unease <strong>Entity 700</strong> expresses in reaction to mentions of Null-06, and the nature of their observed interactions.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-404">Entity 404</a>: As opposed to Null-06, <strong>Entity 700</strong> appeared to have had a positive connection with Entity 404— possibly even to the extent of a “friendship”. She was observed to mourn the loss of Entity 404 in the wake of its consumption by Null-06, which is likely a prominent factor in her rivalry with the latter.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-599">Aster</a>: <strong>Entity 700</strong> fondly regards Aster, whom she met following Entity 404’s demise.

You hold within you the grand force of cataclysm; it lay between your claws and beneath your layers of armor; it streams through your ichor and into your blade. Your hair, now, is clutched between your trembling hands. Though its ability to reflect the celestial skies once brought you visions of movement and flashes of flaring color, it is now dull and mirrors only the faint, dull specks of light far away, just like how empty it is here now<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-950490-2" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >2</a></sup>.<br /> <br /> You think back to when you caught glimpses of people staring at you with eyes full of starlit wonder as you worked, and how you dismissed them harshly. How you had dismissed them by your blade. You remember the petrified, small figures scattered across stations and debris, you remember how they cowered in fear at the sight of you. You had been burdened with such an overwhelming and unforgiving task that you had discarded any potential to be worshiped like the rest of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon">your siblings</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-950490-3" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >3</a></sup>. No, you never thought that such things were important, that they were any more crucial to you than your need for survival and the maintenance of this home you hold dear.<br /> <br /> Yet now, more than ever, you regret it with all of your core<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-950490-4" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >4</a></sup>. It feels so lonesome here, alone and abandoned, <em>forgotten.</em> There was only <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-keymaster/offset/2">one</a> who truly understood you, who made you feel loved, but even he is long gone; a mere shadow of his former self. Now you wish to see faces of wonder, now you wish for once to feel recognized and revered- to stand proudly with your blade to the ground- a promise that you would no longer harm. As your thoughts spiral into what could have been, you feel your body ache. Your shoulders sag from carrying such weight- your lips never once upturned to a smile. Your arms shake and you continue to gaze into the claws clutching your hair, the same claws that once crushed stardust beneath them as you watched its remains attempt to escape your grasp. A god is not supposed to feel so <em>weak,</em> not supposed to feel so <em>useless</em>, you think<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-950490-5" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >5</a></sup>. Had you the power to create, you would be revered. You would not be here, feeding off of cataclysm to survive. You resembled an old potency of decimation, body built with the sturdiness of asteroids and planetary blood, eyes akin to a black hole and hair like a cloak of night torn from the sky. Yet you did not succeed. You did not redeem yourself, did you, <em>O' great Solaris?</em> You chose to lay here and rot alongside all the celestial bodies you've disposed of, with no one to mourn you<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-950490-6" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >6</a></sup>. A grand goddess made pitiful with power that yet remains to be properly used&#8230;<br /> <img src="http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/space-lady-by-soleste/Divider.png" alt="Divider.png" class="image" /><br /> <hr /></div> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-950490-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black-titleblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;black-titlebox&quot;&gt;Welcome Recruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;WARNING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The place you are in right now is known as Training Grounds M-1 or &lt;strong&gt;Level 49.2&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a sub-section of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-49&quot;&gt;Level 49&lt;/a&gt; that nobody but our organization knows about. You are requested to maintain utmost secrecy on the means to access it and to never reveal the sub-section&#039;s existence to the outside public. Alongside the existence of this Mercury base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We once again remind you that any breach of the privacy and rules of our group will be punished accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may now proceed. Glory to the Iron Fist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The environment of the site resembles an abandoned military outpost, with forests circling the entire urban area of the level. It is also filled with broken down or unusable buildings, which are usually salvaged for the construction of better establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissan huts also referred to as storage houses, are the primary resting quarters of each member who lives inside the level. They can be found scattered all across the environment, mainly closer to its center.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/mercury1.PNG&quot; width=&quot;400 px&quot; alt=&quot;mercury1.PNG&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are then two large warehouses, which store all of the weapons and supplies of our faction. The warehouses can only be accessed by captains, who lead each team inside of the faction. Each captain assigns supplies and weapons to each member of their team when it&#039;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/mercury2.PNG&quot; width=&quot;400 px&quot; alt=&quot;mercury2.PNG&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last building of importance is the main base building itself. A large establishment for meetings and easy transportation to the sites of other factions. Next to it, there are the training grounds, which are utilized by all members to refine their techniques and practice battling and assassination. Various kinds of targets and training dummies are used for practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level follows a regular day-night cycle of 24 hours and is devoid of entities while being full of supplies which seem to always appear in most obscure spaces. This made it the perfect place to settle in by our ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally discovered by one of our ex-leaders, Aayan. He and a team of 4 other members had found the entrance to the sub-section by complete luck, as it was initially covered in much soil and debris, with only a few wooden barracks and natural formations for shelter. Ever since then, our faction inhabited this land and utilized it as its main base. To this day, the entrance is kept well hidden from the public eye, and with M.E.G. &#039;s report claiming that the level has no exits, nobody has attempted to thoroughly search for one or accessed the level voluntarily at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black-titleblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;black-titlebox&quot;&gt;Important Information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/Mercury&quot; width=&quot;100 px&quot; alt=&quot;Mercury&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the purpose of this faction?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know already, this faction of the Iron Fist is known as the Mercury faction, we specialize in assassination, infiltration, and capturing. Alongside helping in strategizing for important attacks, our goal is to exterminate all Gods or God-related beings, no matter their identity, for the sake of preserving human lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is the leader of the faction?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our faction is currently under the rule of the great Joan Arteaga, who became leader at just 13 years of age. It is irrefutable proof of her great leadership and battling abilities. She has successfully managed to lead assassinations of dangerous foes, while also maintaining a harsh militaristic leadership that made our troops stronger than ever. Alongside her, there is Madeline Arteaga, her mother, who was our leader before stepping down in her favor. She is Joan&#039;s mentor and guide, a strict and determined woman with a hard heart. Lastly, as the right hand of our Leader, there is Marianne Arteaga, her sister, who leads on the battlefield and knows how to craft the most deadly poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does a recruit need to know that&#039;s most important?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon recruitment, you will be given a key to one of the various Nissan huts, which will become your permanent home. Each hut has a regular-sized simple bed, a toilet, a sink, a wardrobe, a small pantry, and a fridge. Your assigned leader will also give you a beginner weapon and a training uniform. Better weapons can be obtained with good conduct and training progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schedule sheet will be assigned to you upon joining, containing a strict routine that must be followed every day. The routine usually details the timings for training, eating, and missions. It serves as a way to keep everything organized and stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general way to avoid leaving behind traces of you during missions, you must cut your hair soon after joining. It&#039;s also important to not wear any jewelry or accessories for the same reason. An assassin must never leave any trace of themselves behind, or it would compromise us and their identity. Make sure to avoid getting blood on your clothes and wash them quickly if it does happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weapons you will be given will always be small or simple to hide, such as daggers and knives. It&#039;s often suggested to coat the weapons in an extra layer of liquid iron for a better corroding effect against our targets. It has proven to weaken them significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 15 teams in the faction, all named after a letter of the alphabet. Each team has around 25 members. There are no particular differences in the groups and the reason for their existence is to supervise all members properly through the different captains by dividing them into smaller numbers. Captains are elected amongst members upon the death or disappearance of the previous captain. Those who have performed the best in missions are usually chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must not in any way speak of the Iron Fist or our faction in public, or it will result in a need to eliminate anyone who has acquired such information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the ranks in this faction?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 accessible ranks in total, the first one is Simple Soldier, the rank all recruits start with. It allows basic clearance credentials and access to basic weapons. The missions assigned to members of this rank are fairly easy and utilized as training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is then the Experienced Soldier rank, which can be gained after being a member of the faction for a long time. It is obtained through performing various missions and training frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third rank is the Captain rank, which as previously mentioned, not only allows an individual to lead a team of their own but also allows them to have higher credentials and the ability to enter the warehouses for supply shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the fourth rank is known as Right Hand Assistant, a difficult rank to be achieved. This rank would allow someone to closely work with our leader while having the highest credential access possible. It would also allow the individual to directly participate in certain private meetings. Obtaining it is extremely complicated, as our leader would be the one directly assigning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What kind of missions must be performed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missions are often assigned by captains or directly by our Leader. The type of mission varies between ranks, while lower-ranked members are assigned missions with the sole purpose of training, like being requested to assassinate an entity or a minor threat, higher-ranked individuals are assigned true assassination missions on real dangerous threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those kinds of missions, a target is assigned through a document sheet that was produced by our collaborators of the Jupiter faction. The document contains any kind of personal information about the target, it must be studied until a proper plan has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the assassin would be sent to commit their attack and asked to dispose of the body once it has been done. As for kidnapping missions, the procedure is the same, the only difference being the need to keep the target alive and return them to the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missions assigned by our Leader can vary in terms of difficulty, most require group collaboration on a mass attack on multiple threats. All that matters in the end is to stay together and attack from all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determination will be your key to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black-titleblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;black-titlebox&quot;&gt;Entrances and Exits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entrances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing a secret pathway in the Jupiter Base found within &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-105&quot;&gt;level 105&lt;/a&gt; will lead to this sub-section. For more information regarding how to access it, speak to the great Abdias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most utilized and well-hidden method of access to enter the sub-section can be found within the trenches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-49&quot;&gt;level 49&lt;/a&gt; by finding a hidden dug pathway in one of the said trenches. The spot is found in a trench that is marked with a green ribbon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#039;s possible to reach the Jupiter Base in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-105&quot;&gt;level 105&lt;/a&gt; by holding onto a religious book that lacks a symbol and no-clipping through a nearby wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;level 11&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed by going through one of the barracks in the level that is labeled as &amp;quot;11&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By accessing a room marked with a cross and filled with religious artifacts, it&#039;s possible to no-clip to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr-backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/cathedrale-celeste&quot;&gt;Cathedrale Celeste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going through the guarded door marked with a target that is close to the storage warehouse will lead to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-196&quot;&gt;level 196&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;black-titleblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;black-titlebox&quot;&gt;A message of determination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a last step to initiate your journey as a recruit, you will watch a recording that our leader prepared for all new members. It was produced in the hope of further moving your hearts with true justice towards our good cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;Begin Log&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Joan Arteaga is sitting in front of the camera, she is fully visible. Her blue eyes were staring downwards before facing the camera. She passes a hand through her short blond hair, her movements revealing a few scars all across her face.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For millennia, the Gods have torn apart all that we held dear. They&#039;ve destroyed my ancestors, leading them to insanity&amp;#8230; They controlled us and behaved like our commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s only thanks to our group&#039;s efforts&amp;#8230; that we were able to gain the freedom we have today. But our fight is far from over. The traitor still breathes. Barzil igi-bala&amp;#8230; the false man who betrayed us and sacrificed us for his selfish survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until he is dead, our people will never be able to gain their revenge and be put to rest. Wherever there&#039;s a god&amp;#8230; there will be problems, suffering, and evil. None of them can resist the urge of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been&amp;#8230; training my entire life for this single purpose, to eliminate those who hurt us. This purpose is my entire reason for living and I will do whatever it takes to lead you and everyone else to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, you&#039;ve endured the injustice of Gods in the past just like us&amp;#8230; Now you will have the chance for revenge, you will help fix what they took away for a brighter future. The fate of humanity lies on your shoulders&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never let the false deities harm any human being ever again, that is my promise to you all as your leader. My oath of loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a soldier now, your hands will bear the means for our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory to the Iron Fist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;End Log&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

You are requested to maintain utmost secrecy on the means to access it and to never reveal the sub-section's existence to the outside public. Alongside the existence of this Mercury base.</p> <p>We once again remind you that any breach of the privacy and rules of our group will be punished accordingly.</p> <p>You may now proceed. Glory to the Iron Fist.<br /> <br /></p> <h1><span>Description</span></h1> <p><br /> <br /> The environment of the site resembles an abandoned military outpost, with forests circling the entire urban area of the level. It is also filled with broken down or unusable buildings, which are usually salvaged for the construction of better establishments.</p> <p>Nissan huts also referred to as storage houses, are the primary resting quarters of each member who lives inside the level. They can be found scattered all across the environment, mainly closer to its center.<br /> <br /></p> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/mercury1.PNG" width="400 px" alt="mercury1.PNG" class="image" /></div> <p><br /> <br /> There are then two large warehouses, which store all of the weapons and supplies of our faction. The warehouses can only be accessed by captains, who lead each team inside of the faction. Each captain assigns supplies and weapons to each member of their team when it's needed.<br /> <br /></p> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/mercury2.PNG" width="400 px" alt="mercury2.PNG" class="image" /></div> <p><br /> <br /> The last building of importance is the main base building itself. A large establishment for meetings and easy transportation to the sites of other factions. Next to it, there are the training grounds, which are utilized by all members to refine their techniques and practice battling and assassination. Various kinds of targets and training dummies are used for practice.</p> <p>The level follows a regular day-night cycle of 24 hours and is devoid of entities while being full of supplies which seem to always appear in most obscure spaces. This made it the perfect place to settle in by our ancestors.</p> <p>It was originally discovered by one of our ex-leaders, Aayan. He and a team of 4 other members had found the entrance to the sub-section by complete luck, as it was initially covered in much soil and debris, with only a few wooden barracks and natural formations for shelter. Ever since then, our faction inhabited this land and utilized it as its main base. To this day, the entrance is kept well hidden from the public eye, and with M.E.G. 's report claiming that the level has no exits, nobody has attempted to thoroughly search for one or accessed the level voluntarily at all.<br /> <br /></p> </div> <br /> <div class="black-titleblock"> <p><span class="black-titlebox">Important Information</span><br /></p> <div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-49-2/Mercury" width="100 px" alt="Mercury" class="image" /></div> <p><br /></p> <h2><span>What is the purpose of this faction?</span></h2> <p>As you may know already, this faction of the Iron Fist is known as the Mercury faction, we specialize in assassination, infiltration, and capturing. Alongside helping in strategizing for important attacks, our goal is to exterminate all Gods or God-related beings, no matter their identity, for the sake of preserving human lives.</p> <h2><span>Who is the leader of the faction?</span></h2> <p>Our faction is currently under the rule of the great Joan Arteaga, who became leader at just 13 years of age. It is irrefutable proof of her great leadership and battling abilities. She has successfully managed to lead assassinations of dangerous foes, while also maintaining a harsh militaristic leadership that made our troops stronger than ever. Alongside her, there is Madeline Arteaga, her mother, who was our leader before stepping down in her favor. She is Joan's mentor and guide, a strict and determined woman with a hard heart. Lastly, as the right hand of our Leader, there is Marianne Arteaga, her sister, who leads on the battlefield and knows how to craft the most deadly poisons.</p> <h2><span>What does a recruit need to know that's most important?</span></h2> <p>Upon recruitment, you will be given a key to one of the various Nissan huts, which will become your permanent home. Each hut has a regular-sized simple bed, a toilet, a sink, a wardrobe, a small pantry, and a fridge. Your assigned leader will also give you a beginner weapon and a training uniform. Better weapons can be obtained with good conduct and training progress.</p> <p>A schedule sheet will be assigned to you upon joining, containing a strict routine that must be followed every day. The routine usually details the timings for training, eating, and missions. It serves as a way to keep everything organized and stable.</p> <p>As a general way to avoid leaving behind traces of you during missions, you must cut your hair soon after joining. It's also important to not wear any jewelry or accessories for the same reason. An assassin must never leave any trace of themselves behind, or it would compromise us and their identity. Make sure to avoid getting blood on your clothes and wash them quickly if it does happen.</p> <p>The weapons you will be given will always be small or simple to hide, such as daggers and knives. It's often suggested to coat the weapons in an extra layer of liquid iron for a better corroding effect against our targets. It has proven to weaken them significantly.</p> <p>There are about 15 teams in the faction, all named after a letter of the alphabet. Each team has around 25 members. There are no particular differences in the groups and the reason for their existence is to supervise all members properly through the different captains by dividing them into smaller numbers. Captains are elected amongst members upon the death or disappearance of the previous captain. Those who have performed the best in missions are usually chosen.</p> <p>You must not in any way speak of the Iron Fist or our faction in public, or it will result in a need to eliminate anyone who has acquired such information.</p> <h2><span>What are the ranks in this faction?</span></h2> <p>There are 4 accessible ranks in total, the first one is Simple Soldier, the rank all recruits start with. It allows basic clearance credentials and access to basic weapons. The missions assigned to members of this rank are fairly easy and utilized as training.</p> <p>There is then the Experienced Soldier rank, which can be gained after being a member of the faction for a long time. It is obtained through performing various missions and training frequently.</p> <p>The third rank is the Captain rank, which as previously mentioned, not only allows an individual to lead a team of their own but also allows them to have higher credentials and the ability to enter the warehouses for supply shipments.</p> <p>Lastly, the fourth rank is known as Right Hand Assistant, a difficult rank to be achieved. This rank would allow someone to closely work with our leader while having the highest credential access possible. It would also allow the individual to directly participate in certain private meetings. Obtaining it is extremely complicated, as our leader would be the one directly assigning it.</p> <h2><span>What kind of missions must be performed?</span></h2> <p>Missions are often assigned by captains or directly by our Leader. The type of mission varies between ranks, while lower-ranked members are assigned missions with the sole purpose of training, like being requested to assassinate an entity or a minor threat, higher-ranked individuals are assigned true assassination missions on real dangerous threats.</p> <p>For those kinds of missions, a target is assigned through a document sheet that was produced by our collaborators of the Jupiter faction. The document contains any kind of personal information about the target, it must be studied until a proper plan has been made.</p> <p>Then the assassin would be sent to commit their attack and asked to dispose of the body once it has been done. As for kidnapping missions, the procedure is the same, the only difference being the need to keep the target alive and return them to the base.</p> <p>Missions assigned by our Leader can vary in terms of difficulty, most require group collaboration on a mass attack on multiple threats. All that matters in the end is to stay together and attack from all fronts.</p> <p>Determination will be your key to success.</p> </div> <br /> <br /> <div class="black-titleblock"> <p><span class="black-titlebox">Entrances and Exits</span></p> <h3><span>Entrances</span></h3> <ul> <li>Accessing a secret pathway in the Jupiter Base found within <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-105">level 105</a> will lead to this sub-section.

				<description>


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;This tale includes blood and minor gore. Reader discretion is advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up.&amp;quot; Davriel echoed yet again. The black shadows surrounded him as he barely put up with his sword&#039;s endless chatter. He continued through the endless hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;And Then She Bled!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos cackled into his head. The voice was almost reptilian, slightly high-pitched, and extremely piercing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was there. Shut up.&amp;quot; Davriel said again. He was going to have a bloody fit if Aklavos didn&#039;t stop dragging back memories of his victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Yes, But It Felt So Great!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos said malevolently, knowing full well what he was doing. Davriel pulled the blade from its sheath, stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you don&#039;t stop, I&#039;m dropping you,&amp;quot; Davriel said, done with the sword. His voice had become monotone in the past couple of days, dry from lack of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;If You Drop Me, You&#039;re Going To Die.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; The sword replied, and once again Davriel was reminded that he was stuck with the damned thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I might prefer death over your company,&amp;quot; Davriel replied, annoyed. As he took a second to think about what his future held at the moment, he was seriously considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, Don&#039;t Be So Dour. We&#039;re Doing Some Good! &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; Will Probably Kill Everyone In The Backrooms Anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos stated lightheartedly, and Davriel knew the sword was leading him away from the point. Regardless, he was curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And who is He?&amp;quot; Davriel asked. Perhaps this time he&#039;d get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;If You Knew, He Would Kill You.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos replied. Once again, baiting him onto nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Helpful.&amp;quot; He sighed. The blade kept on feeding him bits and pieces, then refusing to explain further. So far, he had put together that the blade used to be someone powerful, got killed for its bloodthirst, and was now a sword. He also got tidbits of an apocalyptic future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re Going The Wrong Way.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; The sword said. After waiting a few seconds, Davriel realized that&#039;s all he was going to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then tell me the right way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Not That Way.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos answered, about as helpful as a pack of rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goddamnit, sword, if that&#039;s the wrong way then &lt;em&gt;tell me the right one&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; Davriel yelled, out loud. He was done with this thing&#039;s bullshit. He just needed a few minutes without the damned blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I Don&#039;t Know.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Of course you don&#039;t!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; He sighed in exasperation, turning around and walking the opposite way. It was a long hallway, and they had turned maybe ten minutes ago on a crossway. &amp;quot;Why don&#039;t we hunt at &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;? It&#039;s filled with people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Because It&#039;s Filled With People.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos said cryptically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So helpful,&amp;quot; Davriel replied, his voice thick with sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; Will Find Us Quicker.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavlos added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this the same &#039;He&#039;?&amp;quot; Davriel asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Am I allowed to ask about this &#039;He&#039;?&amp;quot; Davriel continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Will you ever be useful in the least?&amp;quot; Davriel asked, rhetorically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos yelled emphatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Liar.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I Cannot Lie.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You told me you couldn&#039;t talk.&amp;quot; Davriel countered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I Couldn&#039;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yet you speak.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Now I Can.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel rolled his eyes and continued onward. He could see the turning point in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When are you telling me where we&#039;re going?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;When We Get There.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel looked at the &lt;em&gt;Tachi&lt;/em&gt; with the utmost annoyance, not deeming him worthy of a response. Aklavos seemed okay with that, and they continued in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Davriel reached the crossing and turned. In the distance, a young man stood, maybe eighty feet away. Two doors stood on either side of him, one of them with the number fifty-one etched upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Rend Him.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel continued onward, taking his &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; from his waist and attaching it to his face. It had come in handy if only to desensitize him to the murder. The boy turned. The telltale look of fear was upon his face. Shaking hands, cold sweat, and wide irises. Davriel felt the bloodthirst of both his mask and Aklavos pulling his hand as he stalked towards the boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gods, no! Please, I, I didn&#039;t kill them, I promise I didn&#039;t k-kill them!&amp;quot; He started, eyes upon Davriel. Davriel pulled his blade back, preparing a strike, before hearing a sickening crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the boy exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps exploded wasn&#039;t the best word. The young man&#039;s outsides had twisted into themselves, imploding, and the body rapidly blasted outward, covering Davriel and the nearby wall and floor in blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Run! He Found Us, You Must Run!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos screamed into his head. Davriel felt a migraine coming on, then an overwhelming sense of dread. He pulled back Aklavos, his mask telling him to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;We Can&#039;t Win This!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; The sword warned. The door ahead burst off its hinges onto the opposite wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Forty-eight dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Came the voice of a man, who walked through the door. He had a trench coat on, covering old tactical gear. In his hand was a small &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-80&quot;&gt;Flintlock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;You have made quite the mistake, Davriel. Quite the mistake. I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-74&quot;&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt;. I am Justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Davriel felt a thousand eyes upon him, as Argos continued. &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Curious, that I haven&#039;t met you yet. I normally would feel sin as vilesome as your own. With that blade, you have taken nigh fifty lives. Your soul only claims ten, but I have seen it. Repent now, so you may die in honor. I understand it to be a part of your culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You would dare&amp;#8230; I&#039;m not going to be performing seppuku quite yet. And whoever the hell you are, I have killed entities far stronger.&amp;quot; Davriel threatened. He quickly regretted it. Even Aklavos seemed afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Trust me, you&#039;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; seen anything quite like me. You wear a Volto mask. Curious. You feel more like a vile Sock, or perhaps Oni.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Argos stated. He practically glowed with power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Davriel slashed down, his aim perfect. Argos grabbed the blade with his bare hand and grinned. Pin-pricks of blood ran down the blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Devour!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Aklavos screamed, fear converted to rage as the sword felt the energy behind this being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Wait.. could that be? Singu-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Argos started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stopped as the other door broke open. Two people rushed in, a scarred woman with short hair and a ginger man with what looked to be a military-grade rocket launcher. Davriel&#039;s eyes widened as he scrambled away. The man stayed, aiming the launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argos grimaced and took a dashing step, grabbing the launcher in his hand. The man tried to pull the trigger, and the rocket blasted forth straight at Argos, who pulled their hand up faster than Davriel could see. In Argos&#039;s hand was the rocket launcher, still thrusting forward by a flame. He grabbed it and crushed it. The resulting blast launched the woman away and the man went through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman unhooked two wicked-looking daggers and shook off the blast, before rushing at Argos. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-5&quot;&gt;fell into&lt;/a&gt; the floor, then returned behind her. The ginger pulled out an old smartphone, crawling through the hole in the wall. He played an audio recording, dropped the phone, and then scampered back from the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exterminate.&amp;quot; Echoed the voice of an old woman. Argos narrowed his eyes. He looked upon the young woman and sighed. Davriel slowly edged back through the hall, noting Aklavos&#039;s silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Your soul is overwhelmingly guilty. You must be grateful that I keep my promises.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; Said Argos, who started walking in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman&#039;s eyes flew into a blind rage, and Argos looked at Davriel. Davriel felt blood on his hands and heard the screams of each person he had killed. Argos fell through the floor, noclipping away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel sighed, looking back at the woman. Apparently, the fight wasn&#039;t over. The woman&#039;s face was rabid. The thought of running never entered his mind as he pulled his blade back into a defensive stance and waited. He examined her as she yelled at the floor where Argos had just gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wielded two blades, and her face was ridden with scars. Short hair seemed to imply a militaristic life, and the bloodthirst in her eyes seemed to be greater than even his own. He backed away slowly, and she looked around the room, eyes locking on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She leaped, twin blades whirring as they clashed against his own. The daggers chipped and seemed almost to glow as they moved. Davriel concluded they must have been made of a weaker metal, perhaps copper or iron. Aklavos seemed to be chipping at a similar pace, which confused Davriel. Aklavos had cut through a steel bullet without a scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they dueled, Aklavos made sounds of struggle, as if he was exerting himself. Once again, Davriel was confused. After quite the heavy hit, Davriel cut into the side of her shirt, hitting against&amp;#8230; rusted metal. Beneath her shirt lay iron plates, and whenever Davriel did get a lucky hit in, Aklavos seemed to bounce off instead of cutting through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel came in for a slash to the head, then feinted toward the legs. She expected it, leaping over the blade and landing, back to him as she twirled upon one foot, knife slashing through his arm. He screamed in pain and stepped back, dropping the sword to his right hand. No longer wielding it with both hands as he was trained, it was off balance. He leaned back, trying to use his weight and momentum to make up for it. His reach was fair, but her speed seemed to outmatch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight seemed to go on and on, and eventually, Davriel faded out of consciousness, waking up to see three or four more bloody wounds on his own body and metal chunks taken from her clothes. He barely registered that his hand was moving on its own, that Aklavos was fighting for him. He looked at her again, body sore and tired, and fell unconscious once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four and a half hours later, Davriel sat on the wall, eye shuttering open. The woman lay upon the floor, unconscious. Davriel was covered in cuts and scars, and he slowly rose from the floor, looking at her. She hadn&#039;t taken a single hit to the flesh except the hilt to the head that had taken her out. He sighed again and rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Argos had fallen through lied a mask. He picked it up, recognizing the horn and fangs as an Oni, a part of his religion before he was brought here. He took the Volto mask from upon his face and threw it aside. He no longer needed it. Finally, the doors opened, and three men walked through, armed with assault rifles. Davriel raised his hands, dropping Aklavos and sighing. He didn&#039;t have the energy for another fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They dragged a burlap sack over his head and put his sword into a case. The woman was carefully moved back, and his mask was removed. They dragged him, and he had to rely on only his hearing. His arms were bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They dragged him across a flight of stairs, through a door, and noclipped through something, rendering Davriel nauseous. Eventually, they stopped, and started talking. Davriel could barely make out the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mer..ry..eader..los&amp;#8230;o this idio&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury Leader lost to this idiot? Davriel was unfamiliar with the terms. English wasn&#039;t his first language, and it wasn&#039;t helpful that they were whispering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Perh.. we can&amp;#8230;ing&amp;#8230;him to. Sol?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Jo..n.. wa&amp;#8230;nts to see&amp;#8230; im&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring him to Sol, Jones wants to see him. Great. More dragging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Davriel felt the rough floor as he was dragged back through, more doors and stairs and nauseating Noclipping until he was sure that he would throw up. Eventually, it stopped as the floor changed from stone and plated concrete to carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You awake in there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel stayed silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stubborn bloke, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man pulled Davriel up standing. He took the hood off and frowned. He had a curly mess of oily black hair and was armed with a gun. It looked to be an older model, a ten-round revolver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trust me, mate, no one sleeps through that many noclips.&amp;quot; He laughed, pushing him through the doors. &amp;quot;This is where we check if you&#039;ve anything to do with the divine. You&#039;ll drink this, and if you die, you&#039;re a god! And if you don&#039;t, we call medical support and you&#039;re free to go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He held up a glass vial of the curious glowing metal. Davriel figured out by now that this was either an extremely strange form of solid mercury or iron. The man put it to his mouth, and Davriel had no choice but to drink. It reminded him of burnt cow liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he finished, the man looked at him and frowned.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Aye, you kept alive that long against her, and ain&#039;t a god? Are you an entity or demon, mate? Not like there&#039;s a difference&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I practiced with the sword. She fought like an indignant child with a pair of knives and a point to prove.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh ho ho, don&#039;t let her be hearing that. Well, if you&#039;re done dissing on Mercury, which is completely understandable, we&#039;ll be giving you a few things, telling ya a few things, and sending you off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where is my blade?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your katana?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Tachi&lt;/em&gt;, and yes, what else would I be speaking of?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Give it time, mate. Follow ginger over there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel turned and took a second to look around. It appeared to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-105&quot;&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, with white walls and wooden pillars. The room was small, with a medical stand and IV bags in the corner, and the bag that was previously over his head lay on a bed near him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked ahead, at the far end where a door stood open. Inside stood a woman with red hair waiting expectantly.&lt;br /&gt;
He walked to her and opened his mouth as if to ask something, but she put her hand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait till we get to the office.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he followed her through a messy corridor that branched left and right, with various parts descending into a sterile hospital, and finally stopped at a door. She opened it and led him in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist&quot;&gt;the Iron Fist&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Came a voice. A man stood a few feet away. He sounded barely human, his words reminiscent of Aklavos. &amp;quot;You are in my domain now, and I expect you to adhere to the rules for the duration of your stay. Do not touch anything. Do not speak unless spoken to. And do not move unless told to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel raised his eyebrows, hand moving to his sheath, which he was reminded wasn&#039;t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, and no unnecessary violence. We wouldn&#039;t want you getting hurt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel grimaced. The figure was mostly cloaked by the dark room, but Davriel could see a white cloak and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First of all, have you heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon&quot;&gt;the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, or it&#039;s &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:phenomenon-10&quot;&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A group of false deities making use of powers they don&#039;t deserve. Any other deities you&#039;ve heard of?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides the obvious ones, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7&quot;&gt;Jerry&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-180&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;, no.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mmmm. Have you noticed how all of them are malevolent? They all abuse their powers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&#039;t suppose the cat much does, but sure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That is beside the point. You bear a tattoo on your neck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you see that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A symbol of a Yakuza Assassin, yes? A mercenary who worked for a family to dispose of those who didn&#039;t deserve what they had.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;ve watched too much anime, I see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not mock me, boy. Your services and power would be appreciated on our side. You would be sent to hunt and kill gods and other similar beings. Instead of killing without any such goal, as your M.E.G. file has written.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They already have a file on me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In their archives. One of them got away. Captured by an entity on negative two and escaped.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s not negative two anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides the point. But you kill, be it for pleasure, need, or dementia. We offer you something good to do with that. Besides the useless slaughter you already perform.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up, and Davriel could see a cut-up face with a light beard and albino eyes. Not red, as he first thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Join us, and we offer you a goal, food and water, lodging and companionship, and any other things necessary for your life in the backrooms. And all you&#039;ll have to do is kill a few gods.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Davriel thought for a moment. What were the downsides? And if they wanted to kill him, they would&#039;ve done it by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My sword?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Waiting in the hall.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;ve got yourself a deal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <h3><span><span style="color: red">This tale includes blood and minor gore. Reader discretion is advised.</span></span></h3> <p>&quot;Shut up.&quot; Davriel echoed yet again. The black shadows surrounded him as he barely put up with his sword's endless chatter. He continued through the endless hall.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;And Then She Bled!&quot;</span> Aklavos cackled into his head. The voice was almost reptilian, slightly high-pitched, and extremely piercing.</p> <p>&quot;I was there. Shut up.&quot; Davriel said again. He was going to have a bloody fit if Aklavos didn't stop dragging back memories of his victims.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Yes, Yes, But It Felt So Great!&quot;</span> Aklavos said malevolently, knowing full well what he was doing. Davriel pulled the blade from its sheath, stopping.</p> <p>&quot;If you don't stop, I'm dropping you,&quot; Davriel said, done with the sword. His voice had become monotone in the past couple of days, dry from lack of water.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;If You Drop Me, You're Going To Die.&quot;</span> The sword replied, and once again Davriel was reminded that he was stuck with the damned thing.</p> <p>&quot;I might prefer death over your company,&quot; Davriel replied, annoyed. As he took a second to think about what his future held at the moment, he was seriously considering it.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Oh, Don't Be So Dour. We're Doing Some Good! <em>He</em> Will Probably Kill Everyone In The Backrooms Anyway.&quot;</span> Aklavos stated lightheartedly, and Davriel knew the sword was leading him away from the point. Regardless, he was curious.</p> <p>&quot;And who is He?&quot; Davriel asked. Perhaps this time he'd get an answer.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;If You Knew, He Would Kill You.&quot;</span> Aklavos replied. Once again, baiting him onto nowhere.</p> <p>&quot;Helpful.&quot; He sighed. The blade kept on feeding him bits and pieces, then refusing to explain further. So far, he had put together that the blade used to be someone powerful, got killed for its bloodthirst, and was now a sword. He also got tidbits of an apocalyptic future.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;You're Going The Wrong Way.&quot;</span> The sword said. After waiting a few seconds, Davriel realized that's all he was going to say.</p> <p>&quot;Then tell me the right way.&quot;</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Not That Way.&quot;</span> Aklavos answered, about as helpful as a pack of rocks.</p> <p>&quot;Goddamnit, sword, if that's the wrong way then <em>tell me the right one</em>!&quot; Davriel yelled, out loud. He was done with this thing's bullshit. He just needed a few minutes without the damned blade.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;I Don't Know.&quot;</span></p> <p>&quot;<em>Of course you don't!</em>&quot; He sighed in exasperation, turning around and walking the opposite way. It was a long hallway, and they had turned maybe ten minutes ago on a crossway. &quot;Why don't we hunt at <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>? It's filled with people.&quot;</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Because It's Filled With People.&quot;</span> Aklavos said cryptically.</p> <p>&quot;So helpful,&quot; Davriel replied, his voice thick with sarcasm.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;<em>He</em> Will Find Us Quicker.&quot;</span> Aklavlos added.</p> <p>&quot;Is this the same 'He'?&quot; Davriel asked.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p> <p>&quot;Am I allowed to ask about this 'He'?&quot; Davriel continued.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p> <p>&quot;Will you ever be useful in the least?&quot; Davriel asked, rhetorically.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Yes!&quot;</span> Aklavos yelled emphatically.</p> <p>&quot;Liar.&quot;</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;I Cannot Lie.&quot;</span> Aklavos stated.</p> <p>&quot;You told me you couldn't talk.&quot; Davriel countered.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;I Couldn't.&quot;</span> Aklavos replied.</p> <p>&quot;Yet you speak.&quot;</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Now I Can.&quot;</span></p> <p>Davriel rolled his eyes and continued onward. He could see the turning point in the distance.</p> <p>&quot;When are you telling me where we're going?&quot;</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;When We Get There.&quot;</span></p> <p>Davriel looked at the <em>Tachi</em> with the utmost annoyance, not deeming him worthy of a response. Aklavos seemed okay with that, and they continued in silence.</p> <p>Eventually, Davriel reached the crossing and turned. In the distance, a young man stood, maybe eighty feet away. Two doors stood on either side of him, one of them with the number fifty-one etched upon it.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Rend Him.&quot;</span> Aklavos commanded.</p> <p>Davriel continued onward, taking his <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">mask</a> from his waist and attaching it to his face. It had come in handy if only to desensitize him to the murder. The boy turned. The telltale look of fear was upon his face. Shaking hands, cold sweat, and wide irises. Davriel felt the bloodthirst of both his mask and Aklavos pulling his hand as he stalked towards the boy.</p> <p>&quot;Gods, no! Please, I, I didn't kill them, I promise I didn't k-kill them!&quot; He started, eyes upon Davriel. Davriel pulled his blade back, preparing a strike, before hearing a sickening crunch.</p> <p>Then the boy exploded.</p> <p>Perhaps exploded wasn't the best word. The young man's outsides had twisted into themselves, imploding, and the body rapidly blasted outward, covering Davriel and the nearby wall and floor in blood.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Run! He Found Us, You Must Run!&quot;</span> Aklavos screamed into his head. Davriel felt a migraine coming on, then an overwhelming sense of dread. He pulled back Aklavos, his mask telling him to continue.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;We Can't Win This!&quot;</span> The sword warned. The door ahead burst off its hinges onto the opposite wall.</p> <p><span style="color: navy">&quot;Forty-eight dead.&quot;</span> Came the voice of a man, who walked through the door. He had a trench coat on, covering old tactical gear. In his hand was a small <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-80">Flintlock</a>.</p> <p><span style="color: navy">&quot;You have made quite the mistake, Davriel. Quite the mistake. I am <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-74">Argos</a>. I am Justice.&quot;</span> Davriel felt a thousand eyes upon him, as Argos continued. <span style="color: navy">&quot;Curious, that I haven't met you yet. I normally would feel sin as vilesome as your own. With that blade, you have taken nigh fifty lives. Your soul only claims ten, but I have seen it. Repent now, so you may die in honor. I understand it to be a part of your culture.&quot;</span></p> <p>&quot;You would dare&#8230; I'm not going to be performing seppuku quite yet. And whoever the hell you are, I have killed entities far stronger.&quot; Davriel threatened. He quickly regretted it. Even Aklavos seemed afraid.</p> <p><span style="color: navy">&quot;Trust me, you've <em>never</em> seen anything quite like me. You wear a Volto mask. Curious. You feel more like a vile Sock, or perhaps Oni.&quot;</span> Argos stated. He practically glowed with power.</p> <p>Despite that, Davriel slashed down, his aim perfect. Argos grabbed the blade with his bare hand and grinned. Pin-pricks of blood ran down the blade.</p> <p><span style="color: red">&quot;Devour!&quot;</span> Aklavos screamed, fear converted to rage as the sword felt the energy behind this being.</p> <p><span style="color: navy">&quot;Wait.. could that be? Singu-&quot;</span> Argos started.</p> <p>He stopped as the other door broke open. Two people rushed in, a scarred woman with short hair and a ginger man with what looked to be a military-grade rocket launcher. Davriel's eyes widened as he scrambled away. The man stayed, aiming the launcher.</p> <p>Argos grimaced and took a dashing step, grabbing the launcher in his hand. The man tried to pull the trigger, and the rocket blasted forth straight at Argos, who pulled their hand up faster than Davriel could see. In Argos's hand was the rocket launcher, still thrusting forward by a flame. He grabbed it and crushed it. The resulting blast launched the woman away and the man went through the wall.</p> <p>The woman unhooked two wicked-looking daggers and shook off the blast, before rushing at Argos. He <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-5">fell into</a> the floor, then returned behind her. The ginger pulled out an old smartphone, crawling through the hole in the wall. He played an audio recording, dropped the phone, and then scampered back from the hall.</p> <p>&quot;Exterminate.&quot; Echoed the voice of an old woman. Argos narrowed his eyes. He looked upon the young woman and sighed. Davriel slowly edged back through the hall, noting Aklavos's silence.</p> <p><span style="color: navy">&quot;Your soul is overwhelmingly guilty. You must be grateful that I keep my promises.&quot;</span> Said Argos, who started walking in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The woman's eyes flew into a blind rage, and Argos looked at Davriel. Davriel felt blood on his hands and heard the screams of each person he had killed. Argos fell through the floor, noclipping away.</p> <p>Davriel sighed, looking back at the woman. Apparently, the fight wasn't over. The woman's face was rabid. The thought of running never entered his mind as he pulled his blade back into a defensive stance and waited. He examined her as she yelled at the floor where Argos had just gone.</p> <p>She wielded two blades, and her face was ridden with scars. Short hair seemed to imply a militaristic life, and the bloodthirst in her eyes seemed to be greater than even his own. He backed away slowly, and she looked around the room, eyes locking on him.</p> <p>She leaped, twin blades whirring as they clashed against his own. The daggers chipped and seemed almost to glow as they moved. Davriel concluded they must have been made of a weaker metal, perhaps copper or iron. Aklavos seemed to be chipping at a similar pace, which confused Davriel. Aklavos had cut through a steel bullet without a scratch.</p> <p>As they dueled, Aklavos made sounds of struggle, as if he was exerting himself. Once again, Davriel was confused. After quite the heavy hit, Davriel cut into the side of her shirt, hitting against&#8230; rusted metal. Beneath her shirt lay iron plates, and whenever Davriel did get a lucky hit in, Aklavos seemed to bounce off instead of cutting through.</p> <p>Davriel came in for a slash to the head, then feinted toward the legs. She expected it, leaping over the blade and landing, back to him as she twirled upon one foot, knife slashing through his arm. He screamed in pain and stepped back, dropping the sword to his right hand. No longer wielding it with both hands as he was trained, it was off balance. He leaned back, trying to use his weight and momentum to make up for it. His reach was fair, but her speed seemed to outmatch it.</p> <p>The fight seemed to go on and on, and eventually, Davriel faded out of consciousness, waking up to see three or four more bloody wounds on his own body and metal chunks taken from her clothes. He barely registered that his hand was moving on its own, that Aklavos was fighting for him. He looked at her again, body sore and tired, and fell unconscious once more.</p> <p>Four and a half hours later, Davriel sat on the wall, eye shuttering open. The woman lay upon the floor, unconscious. Davriel was covered in cuts and scars, and he slowly rose from the floor, looking at her. She hadn't taken a single hit to the flesh except the hilt to the head that had taken her out. He sighed again and rose.</p> <p>Where Argos had fallen through lied a mask. He picked it up, recognizing the horn and fangs as an Oni, a part of his religion before he was brought here. He took the Volto mask from upon his face and threw it aside. He no longer needed it. Finally, the doors opened, and three men walked through, armed with assault rifles. Davriel raised his hands, dropping Aklavos and sighing. He didn't have the energy for another fight.</p> <p>They dragged a burlap sack over his head and put his sword into a case. The woman was carefully moved back, and his mask was removed. They dragged him, and he had to rely on only his hearing. His arms were bound.</p> <p>They dragged him across a flight of stairs, through a door, and noclipped through something, rendering Davriel nauseous. Eventually, they stopped, and started talking. Davriel could barely make out the words.</p> <p>&quot;Mer..ry..eader..los&#8230;o this idio&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>Mercury Leader lost to this idiot? Davriel was unfamiliar with the terms. English wasn't his first language, and it wasn't helpful that they were whispering.</p> <p>&quot;Perh.. we can&#8230;ing&#8230;him to. Sol?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No. Jo..n.. wa&#8230;nts to see&#8230; im&quot;</p> <p>Bring him to Sol, Jones wants to see him. Great. More dragging.</p> <p>Then Davriel felt the rough floor as he was dragged back through, more doors and stairs and nauseating Noclipping until he was sure that he would throw up. Eventually, it stopped as the floor changed from stone and plated concrete to carpet.</p> <p>&quot;You awake in there?&quot;</p> <p>Davriel stayed silent.</p> <p>&quot;Stubborn bloke, eh?&quot;</p> <p>The man pulled Davriel up standing. He took the hood off and frowned. He had a curly mess of oily black hair and was armed with a gun. It looked to be an older model, a ten-round revolver.</p> <p>&quot;Trust me, mate, no one sleeps through that many noclips.&quot; He laughed, pushing him through the doors. &quot;This is where we check if you've anything to do with the divine. You'll drink this, and if you die, you're a god! And if you don't, we call medical support and you're free to go.&quot;</p> <p>He held up a glass vial of the curious glowing metal. Davriel figured out by now that this was either an extremely strange form of solid mercury or iron. The man put it to his mouth, and Davriel had no choice but to drink. It reminded him of burnt cow liver.</p> <p>After he finished, the man looked at him and frowned.<br /> &quot;Aye, you kept alive that long against her, and ain't a god? Are you an entity or demon, mate? Not like there's a difference&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I practiced with the sword. She fought like an indignant child with a pair of knives and a point to prove.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh ho ho, don't let her be hearing that. Well, if you're done dissing on Mercury, which is completely understandable, we'll be giving you a few things, telling ya a few things, and sending you off to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Where is my blade?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Your katana?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Tachi</em>, and yes, what else would I be speaking of?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Give it time, mate. Follow ginger over there.&quot;</p> <p>Davriel turned and took a second to look around. It appeared to be a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-105">chapel</a>, with white walls and wooden pillars. The room was small, with a medical stand and IV bags in the corner, and the bag that was previously over his head lay on a bed near him.</p> <p>He looked ahead, at the far end where a door stood open. Inside stood a woman with red hair waiting expectantly.<br /> He walked to her and opened his mouth as if to ask something, but she put her hand up.</p> <p>&quot;Wait till we get to the office.&quot;</p> <p>So he followed her through a messy corridor that branched left and right, with various parts descending into a sterile hospital, and finally stopped at a door. She opened it and led him in.</p> <p>&quot;Welcome to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist">the Iron Fist</a>.&quot; Came a voice. A man stood a few feet away. He sounded barely human, his words reminiscent of Aklavos. &quot;You are in my domain now, and I expect you to adhere to the rules for the duration of your stay. Do not touch anything. Do not speak unless spoken to. And do not move unless told to.&quot;</p> <p>Davriel raised his eyebrows, hand moving to his sheath, which he was reminded wasn't there.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, and no unnecessary violence. We wouldn't want you getting hurt.&quot;</p> <p>Davriel grimaced. The figure was mostly cloaked by the dark room, but Davriel could see a white cloak and red eyes.</p> <p>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;First of all, have you heard of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon">the Pantheon</a>, or it's <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:phenomenon-10">gods</a>?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;A group of false deities making use of powers they don't deserve. Any other deities you've heard of?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Besides the obvious ones, such as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-7">Jerry</a> and that <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-180">cat</a>, no.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Mmmm. Have you noticed how all of them are malevolent? They all abuse their powers.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don't suppose the cat much does, but sure.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That is beside the point. You bear a tattoo on your neck.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;How did you see that?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;A symbol of a Yakuza Assassin, yes? A mercenary who worked for a family to dispose of those who didn't deserve what they had.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You've watched too much anime, I see.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Do not mock me, boy. Your services and power would be appreciated on our side. You would be sent to hunt and kill gods and other similar beings. Instead of killing without any such goal, as your M.E.G. file has written.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They already have a file on me?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;In their archives. One of them got away. Captured by an entity on negative two and escaped.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's not negative two anymore.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Besides the point. But you kill, be it for pleasure, need, or dementia. We offer you something good to do with that. Besides the useless slaughter you already perform.&quot;</p> <p>He stood up, and Davriel could see a cut-up face with a light beard and albino eyes. Not red, as he first thought.</p> <p>&quot;Join us, and we offer you a goal, food and water, lodging and companionship, and any other things necessary for your life in the backrooms. And all you'll have to do is kill a few gods.&quot;<br /> Davriel thought for a moment. What were the downsides? And if they wanted to kill him, they would've done it by now.</p> <p>&quot;My sword?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Waiting in the hall.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You've got yourself a deal.&quot;</p> <div style="text-align: center;"></div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-wrapper"> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/let-the-blade-drink-deeper">Let The Blade Drink Deeper</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/let-your-justice-be-swift">Let Your Justice Be Swift</a> | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/let-your-light-shine-again">Let Your Light Shine Again</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kkitsunebi" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7888847&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713088" alt="KKitsunebi" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7888847)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kkitsunebi" >KKitsunebi</a></span></p>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a peaceful day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/a&gt;, around 200 years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/philia&quot;&gt;Philia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-10&quot;&gt;avatar of Love&lt;/a&gt;, had been notified of the existence of a new avatar of Comprehension to replace &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-allseer&quot;&gt;the previous&lt;/a&gt;. Enthusiastic to meet someone else like her, she immediately set off to meet him.
&lt;p&gt;She wondered what he&#039;d look like, how he&#039;d act, what kind of things he would like&amp;#8230; She even considered going back to make him a gift but decided against it. No time to waste, after all! There was no turning back now &amp;#8212; she could sense him just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goddess quietly looked around for the mysterious avatar, only to stumble upon him as he was frantically trying to collect his bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my gosh!! You&#039;re a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;faceling?!&lt;/a&gt; That&#039;s awesome! I&#039;ve never seen someone like you before! It&#039;s so nice to meet you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was bursting with happy energy, analyzing him with her pink eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, yes, pleased to meet you&amp;#8230; but who do you think you&#039;re talking to? &lt;em&gt;&#039;Faceling&#039;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230; I must say, I&#039;m not familiar with a term like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a happy nonchalance to him, but he was clearly confused by her demeanour. He&#039;d never met anyone else before, but he thought this was certainly a peculiar first greeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! A Faceling is a faceless entity. Usually, they can&#039;t communicate verbally at all &amp;#8212; but you can! Isn&#039;t that amazing? You&#039;re very similar to how I imagined you, I knew I was right!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She examined his glasses from a distance, wondering what kind of power they held. They were gilded, just like the rest of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Silly me, forgetting to introduce myself! I&#039;m Philia, the goddess of Love. You must be the god of Comprehension, and a version of the&amp;#8212; n-never-mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quickly grew embarassed and took a few breaths to compose herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A version of the..?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, you&#039;re new. You need to get to grips with life before we get into silly things like that, haha!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philia carried herself in such a light and breezy manner that the Alchemist was compelled not to question her further and kill the mood. Still, he kept his curiosity in his back pocket. He&#039;d look into her later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I suppose that&#039;s right. I&#039;d introduce myself, but I don&#039;t have a name. Call me &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-alchemist&quot;&gt;the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pretended to be surprised in an attempt not to worry him. She didn&#039;t want to look weird or odd; she&#039;d come clean sometime, just not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No name? Well, the Alchemist works just fine. Why don&#039;t I show you around? You need a place to stay in after all! There are so many things I can teach you, I can&#039;t wait!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pink hearts started floating around her &amp;#8212; bottling her happiness clearly didn&#039;t work. It&#039;s always pretty visible with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I suppose I do need somewhere to stay! But don&#039;t try anything funny&amp;#8230; I&#039;m not quite sure what&#039;s going on yet, but I&#039;m going to figure it out. That goes for everything &amp;#8212; even you, Philia!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been an intimidating sentiment from somebody else, but he was new to this realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, she already &lt;a href=&quot;https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Alchemist&quot;&gt;knew him very well&lt;/a&gt;. Why wouldn&#039;t she trust him?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Alchemist,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;This is a letter for you, to remind you just how much I cherish you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;You and your all-seeing glasses always had something new to show me! I remember that time you engineered me a perfume that was so tailored to me that all these years later I still wear it&amp;#8230; not to mention the pages and pages of notes that came with it. You should take more pride in your writing, it kept me hooked all day! After I figured out your handwriting, that is&amp;#8230; I miss how enthusiastic you used to be about your research, but I suppose I should have expected us to grow jaded over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;I was quite lonely in that period, but your presence filled a void in my heart. You let me stick around you and watch your brilliant mind at work, I won&#039;t stop thanking you for that, never. You always understood me more than I could ever understand myself, without you, I don&#039;t think I would be the Philia I am right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;I wonder if you remember the first time I presented &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fengari-god-of-thoughts&quot;&gt;Fengári&lt;/a&gt; to you. It was quite difficult to get around convincing &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/fengari-god-of-thoughts/offset/1&quot;&gt;you-know-who&lt;/a&gt;, but with a bit of luck, we managed! Remember how their eyes lit up seeing the books and the papers you owned? It was absolutely adorable&amp;#8230; Fengári was never much of an extrovert, but you took the time to suit their needs and their shyness. You are the only one who tried learning sign language for them. You have a heart of gold, my dear Alchemist, quite literally! Mentoring them was the best thing you could do for them, they could finally find some happiness despite their isolation&amp;#8230; My poor Fengári&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;I miss them, I miss them as much as you do. I know things aren&#039;t the same, how could they be? Without Fengári by our side&amp;#8230; everything is darker. I will be strong for their sake and I know you too will also find strength in this sea of nothing. We will get them out, I swore on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;Despite everything, you still stand by my side. No matter how much of a burden I feel like, you do not consider me such. Learning how to love myself is difficult, but you make it a better experience. Your silly antics and your disguised attempts to check on me are proof enough of that. You may be quite odd, but so am I.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;My fondest memory with you, was when you showed me how to create a potion that would create pink heart-shaped clouds! It was lovely, believe me, I&#039;ve kept the little bottle as a memory of it. If we ever make potions together in the future, I promise to not burn everything like I almost did that time! I am not so clumsy anymore; pinky promise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;My dear Alchemist, I hope you appreciate that you and I are closer than I am to most. The day you figured out &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pillar-scripture&quot;&gt;my biggest secret&lt;/a&gt;, I was worried you&#039;d freak out&amp;#8230; but you just had a million questions to ask about it! I trusted you with the truth back then in a heartbeat, and I&#039;d do it again. Would you do that too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;Discovering you here, again&amp;#8230; I hope I can be friends with you everywhere, just like this. I wish I could do it all over again, to be honest. To return to how things were. Maybe then, we could always be happy. I wonder if you feel the same way sometimes, but I guess you&#039;d be more focused on the future. &amp;quot;You can&#039;t change the past, Philia! So what&#039;s the point of blaming yourself?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;&amp;#8230;She always used to say that. You&#039;re so alike, even if you don&#039;t see it that way. I guess I still have some guilt about what happened&amp;#8230; but you&#039;ve given me another chance. I think you&#039;re right about the past and the future &amp;#8212; I should focus on the version of you that exists here and now! Maybe then, we&#039;ll all survive. Even with our scars, we will never be forgotten&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;For Allseer&#039;s sake, for Fengári, for the sake of all those who loved me&amp;#8230; I hope this time, I can be a good friend. For as long as you wish to keep me around, I will follow after you with a smile. The same smile you give me when we are together. I plead with you never to drop it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;One day, when everything is over, we three will sit by a calm tree and read a nice book like we used to. All of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Kalam&quot;&gt;Until then, I can only dream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With love, Philia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Enthusiastic to meet someone else like her, she immediately set off to meet him. <p>She wondered what he'd look like, how he'd act, what kind of things he would like&#8230; She even considered going back to make him a gift but decided against it. No time to waste, after all!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity 333&lt;/strong&gt;, AKA &amp;quot;Lorenzo Windsor&amp;quot;, is a widely-rumored entity known to appear to new wanderers via their minds, specifically those who have lost significant memories of their lives in the Frontrooms. Although there is no concrete proof of his existence, he seems to have the ability to visit humans he chooses to interact with, as evidenced by multiple reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the dearth of any proper eyewitnesses, there exists various contrasting information on the entity. However, according to our existing files, Lorenzo is typically reported to have &amp;quot;multicolored, kaleidoscopic eyes and dirty blond hair with moderately long bangs, with its tips having red streaks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His clothing varies depending on the person, though he is usually described wearing &amp;quot;a tuxedo consisting of a black button-up shirt, a yellow vest, and a red suit, covered by a dark red royal robe&amp;quot;. He is also often seen possessing a ruby amulet and a gray cravat. Some sources suggest he wears an off-white button-up shirt, and others reported him to be a faceless, glitching being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a drastic variety of details, there remains one constant variable in these reports. This is the presence of an uncanny, glitching crown sitting on top of the entity&#039;s head, with spires similar to that of spider legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;science&lt;/span&gt;Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo is known to be a humanoid reminiscent of a young Caucasian male &amp;#8212; allegedly around the age of 15-18 &amp;#8212; standing at an average mean of 5’9. Although possessing a biology similar to humans, he was reported to have a &#039;dread signature&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#039;dread signature&#039; he gives off can only be described &amp;#8212; by all of our subjects &amp;#8212; as a paranoia-inducing aura which causes a person&#039;s repressed experiences to forcefully resurface, oftentimes driving them into an almost deja vu-like trance state. Being in close contact with the entity for more than five minutes may cause one&#039;s memories to &#039;melt&#039; and &#039;corrode&#039; or go under anamnesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; height: 0px; font-size: 1px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;Discovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have not yet seen active sightings of Lorenzo, he has been a notable figure to most new wanderers who seem to have lost chunks of memories prior to no-clipping. So far, everyone who reported this strange man consecutively noted a &amp;quot;crown&amp;quot; on his head, concluding he might actually exist (and is, in fact, not a result of mass hysteria or collective hallucination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a recording of three interviews regarding Lorenzo Windsor, given that they are some of the most detailed files we have so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW:&lt;/strong&gt; REPORT ON &#039;LORENZO WINDSOR&#039;: CASE #1&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; M.E.G. Officer&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Alex&amp;quot; (Name supplemented for anonymity); aged 36&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What happened the first time you got here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “It was a dream. &amp;#8230; No, no, a &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt;. I-I think. There was a man, a strange young man. He didn&#039;t seem harmful, but h-he was there. I saw him looking at me blankly. He seemed like he was&amp;#8230; observing me. Everything seemed so real, a-as if&amp;#8230; as if I was there, in front of him&amp;#8212; The silence, it was deafening&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Is that all? Did he tell you his intentions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “No. He did not say anything. He simply&amp;#8230; uh, he simply summoned a cup of tea and drank it. He did not even greet me or whatever. Weird guy&amp;#8230; his eyes were weird; colorful, despondent, nostalgic, like he&#039;s r-remembering something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Uh huh, and what else did he do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “Um, he later spoke. He spoke via that brain thing&amp;#8212;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Telepathy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “Y-Yes, that. He spoke to me. He did not have a voice, he did not open his mouth, h-he just shoved a bunch of words into my head, as if they were my thoughts but they were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Hey, hey, it&#039;s okay. He&#039;s not here. &amp;#8230; What was said?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “Um&amp;#8212; W-Well, he told me his name. &#039;Lorenzo Windsor&#039; or something, claimed he was some form of&amp;#8230; king&amp;#8230; I-I mean, he had this weird crown thing on his head, so I guess that checks out, but he also said he&#039;s been watching me through my&amp;#8212; erm, my m&amp;#8230; memories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What else did you feel?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “I felt&amp;#8230; the wind. I felt it&amp;#8230; And then I-I stared at them, into his eyes, and I felt&amp;#8212; I felt off. So damn &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. It was this&amp;#8230; thing. This&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Like an energy, an aura, so unlike anything I&#039;ve ever encountered. He knew my name, my past, and yet, I-I&#039;ve got no clue on what my old life was all about. H-He&amp;#8212; His eyes, they showed it to me, he showed me my future through memories I had not yet experienced, and how I am going to die, h-how I&#039;m&amp;#8212; Oh, oh God, oh fucking God&amp;#8212;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He starts hyperventilating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G Officer: “Please, calm down! Do you want to go home?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex stared at his hands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Alex?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex was unresponsive for a few moments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Alex&amp;#8230;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “&amp;#8230; Officer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Alex&amp;#8230; What&#039;s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex: “I-I want to see my family again. Please, please&amp;#8212; I want to see them again! Tell them I am sorry, please! Please!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex began to behave erratically, trashing around the area. A few men were tasked to hold him down and Alex was eventually sedated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next day, Alex was missing from the outpost. A letter was then found lying on his table, dedicated to someone he claimed he misses dearly. It has been rumored that since then, Alex developed something close to fugue and went on to search for a &#039;family&#039; that never existed in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Lorenzo, while unmalicious, is still under research due to the disastrous effects that affect human beings during encounters with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW:&lt;/strong&gt; REPORT ON &#039;LORENZO WINDSOR&#039;: CASE #2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; M.E.G. Officer&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot; (Name supplemented for anonymity); aged 62&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “So, you&#039;re one of the other witnesses of this&amp;#8230; Lorenzo entity?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “He was not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; an entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “&amp;#8230; Uh, sorry, what did you just say?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “L-Listen to me, officer. These things, entities, erm- whatever you want to call them&amp;#8212; They were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be trifled with. I saw what this thing was able to do, the amount of stuff he knew about me, it was creepy as hell. As if he was some&amp;#8230; god. It was weird&amp;#8230; His aura&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Mhm-hm, was it the same man as what everyone else told us about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “No, no, he was not&amp;#8212; He looked really weird, like his entire face was glitching and loading like a black screen&amp;#8212; He had this weird crown, a-and he did not have a mouth, like, none at all, but he spoke anyway, and I have to tell you &lt;em&gt;right fucking now&lt;/em&gt;, we should delete everything we know about this guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “We cannot do that, Bob.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “&amp;#8230; He didn&#039;t have a face. He&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “He&amp;#8230; what&amp;#8230;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob seemed anxious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “&amp;#8230; He didn&#039;t have a face. He wore white clothes, but he had no face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What do you mean by &#039;no face&#039;, Bob? Like a faceli&amp;#8212;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “He had no face! It was all a &lt;em&gt;void&lt;/em&gt;! S-Staring at me, staring&amp;#8230; at&amp;#8230; me&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “&amp;#8230; Did he&amp;#8230; tell you anything?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob begins to cry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “I was told to forget what happened to my wife, as the pain may be too unbearable for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “&amp;#8230; Anything else?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob began to shake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “I-I stared. I stared into the ravine which was his face. I can never go back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “&amp;#8230; Where, Bob? To where?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob: “I want my dearest Masha. Please, give her back to me&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Was Masha your wife, Bob? What&amp;#8230; happened to her?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob did not respond. After that event, Bob was rendered mute and was sent to therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Bob&#039;s brain scans revealed a very rapid onset of cognitive decline. Moreover, further tests showed signs for a possible diagnosis of dementia, as evidenced by unnatural and abrupt atrophy in his frontal lobe and hippocampal area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW:&lt;/strong&gt; REPORT ON &#039;LORENZO WINDSOR&#039;: CASE #3&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; M.E.G. Officer&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; Dorothy Wells; aged 22&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “Hi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Hello, Dorothy. Are you able to recount your encounter?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dorothy shivered and nodded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “He told me his name was Lorenzo. He had this&amp;#8230; weird crown on&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She took a deep breath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “I didn&#039;t look into his eyes. He didn&#039;t want me to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What did he look like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “He was like a man, but there was something wrong with him. And he had some&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;dread&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Describe it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “Scary. Like he&#039;s staring at my soul through the lens of my past. He knew my mother. He said she abandoned me when I was seven. I didn&#039;t remember having met her at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What else did Lorenzo mention?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy: “I- I&amp;#8230; I didn&#039;t remember. I just&amp;#8230; I just knew I need to keep living on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Due to the encounter with Lorenzo, Dorothy temporarily developed false memories of her past. Although Ms. Wells never experienced anything serious, she often drew images of the entity. However, most of them were thrown to the fire by Dorothy herself after slowly recovering from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is currently taking therapy and is doing well under the care of the M.E.G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;psychology&lt;/span&gt;Behaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although knowledge pertaining to Lorenzo is still widely unknown, he has been reported to act calm, quiet, and asocial, showing intense aversion towards any form of touch and eye contact, as anyone who would stare directly into his eyes may experience the effects of (or something similar to) &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-43&quot;&gt;Phenomenon 43&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;It seems as if he does not want any mortal to experience these effects, hence his avoidance. It is unclear if he is able to control it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has been reported to have the ability to consume food, as evidenced by one of the interviews with &amp;quot;Alex&amp;quot;. Whether he needs this to survive or not is up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, according to witnesses, Lorenzo has been quite helpful, oftentimes assisting people in near states of amnesia remember their past to give them the vigor to keep going on. A common theory among wanderers who have encountered him suggests that he might either be doing this out of his own free will, or that he feels a strong or certain need to. Reports suggest that he is especially docile to children to whom he would seldomly hum a few songs. He would do so while staring at the floor or somewhere else in a dissociative, idle state, reminiscing about something of which is still unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Although there is no concrete proof of his existence, he seems to have the ability to visit humans he chooses to interact with, as evidenced by multiple reports.</p> <p>Due to the dearth of any proper eyewitnesses, there exists various contrasting information on the entity. However, according to our existing files, Lorenzo is typically reported to have &quot;multicolored, kaleidoscopic eyes and dirty blond hair with moderately long bangs, with its tips having red streaks&quot;.</p> <p>His clothing varies depending on the person, though he is usually described wearing &quot;a tuxedo consisting of a black button-up shirt, a yellow vest, and a red suit, covered by a dark red royal robe&quot;. He is also often seen possessing a ruby amulet and a gray cravat. Some sources suggest he wears an off-white button-up shirt, and others reported him to be a faceless, glitching being.</p> <p>Despite a drastic variety of details, there remains one constant variable in these reports. This is the presence of an uncanny, glitching crown sitting on top of the entity's head, with spires similar to that of spider legs.</p> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">science</span>Biology</span></h2> <p>Lorenzo is known to be a humanoid reminiscent of a young Caucasian male &#8212; allegedly around the age of 15-18 &#8212; standing at an average mean of 5’9. Although possessing a biology similar to humans, he was reported to have a 'dread signature'.</p> <p>The 'dread signature' he gives off can only be described &#8212; by all of our subjects &#8212; as a paranoia-inducing aura which causes a person's repressed experiences to forcefully resurface, oftentimes driving them into an almost deja vu-like trance state. Being in close contact with the entity for more than five minutes may cause one's memories to 'melt' and 'corrode' or go under anamnesis.</p> </div> <div style="clear:both; height: 0px; font-size: 1px"></div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">search</span>Discovery</span></h2> <p>Although we have not yet seen active sightings of Lorenzo, he has been a notable figure to most new wanderers who seem to have lost chunks of memories prior to no-clipping. So far, everyone who reported this strange man consecutively noted a &quot;crown&quot; on his head, concluding he might actually exist (and is, in fact, not a result of mass hysteria or collective hallucination.)</p> <p>Below is a recording of three interviews regarding Lorenzo Windsor, given that they are some of the most detailed files we have so far.</p> <div class="blockquote"> <p><tt><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> REPORT ON 'LORENZO WINDSOR': CASE #1</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewee:</strong> &quot;Alex&quot; (Name supplemented for anonymity); aged 36</tt></p> <hr /> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “What happened the first time you got here?”</p> <p>Alex: “It was a dream. &#8230; No, no, a <em>memory</em>. I-I think. There was a man, a strange young man. He didn't seem harmful, but h-he was there. I saw him looking at me blankly. He seemed like he was&#8230; observing me. Everything seemed so real, a-as if&#8230; as if I was there, in front of him&#8212; The silence, it was deafening&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Is that all? Did he tell you his intentions?”</p> <p>Alex: “No. He did not say anything. He simply&#8230; uh, he simply summoned a cup of tea and drank it. He did not even greet me or whatever. Weird guy&#8230; his eyes were weird; colorful, despondent, nostalgic, like he's r-remembering something.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Uh huh, and what else did he do?”</p> <p>Alex: “Um, he later spoke. He spoke via that brain thing&#8212;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Telepathy?”</p> <p>Alex: “Y-Yes, that. He spoke to me. He did not have a voice, he did not open his mouth, h-he just shoved a bunch of words into my head, as if they were my thoughts but they were <em>not</em>-”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Hey, hey, it's okay. He's not here. &#8230; What was said?”</p> <p>Alex: “Um&#8212; W-Well, he told me his name. 'Lorenzo Windsor' or something, claimed he was some form of&#8230; king&#8230; I-I mean, he had this weird crown thing on his head, so I guess that checks out, but he also said he's been watching me through my&#8212; erm, my m&#8230; memories.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “What else did you feel?”</p> <p>Alex: “I felt&#8230; the wind. I felt it&#8230; And then I-I stared at them, into his eyes, and I felt&#8212; I felt off. So damn <em>off</em>. It was this&#8230; thing. This&#8230; <em><strong>dread</strong></em>. Like an energy, an aura, so unlike anything I've ever encountered. He knew my name, my past, and yet, I-I've got no clue on what my old life was all about. H-He&#8212; His eyes, they showed it to me, he showed me my future through memories I had not yet experienced, and how I am going to die, h-how I'm&#8212; Oh, oh God, oh fucking God&#8212;”</p> <p><em>He starts hyperventilating.</em></p> <p>M.E.G Officer: “Please, calm down! Do you want to go home?”</p> <p><em>Alex stared at his hands.</em></p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Alex?”</p> <p><em>Alex was unresponsive for a few moments.</em></p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Alex&#8230;?”</p> <p>Alex: “&#8230; Officer.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Alex&#8230; What's wrong?”</p> <p>Alex: “I-I want to see my family again. Please, please&#8212; I want to see them again! Tell them I am sorry, please! Please!”</p> <p><em>Alex began to behave erratically, trashing around the area. A few men were tasked to hold him down and Alex was eventually sedated.</em></p> <p><em>The next day, Alex was missing from the outpost. A letter was then found lying on his table, dedicated to someone he claimed he misses dearly. It has been rumored that since then, Alex developed something close to fugue and went on to search for a 'family' that never existed in the first place.</em></p> <p><em>His whereabouts are currently unknown.</em></p> <hr /> <p>Conclusion: Lorenzo, while unmalicious, is still under research due to the disastrous effects that affect human beings during encounters with him.</p> </div> <div class="blockquote"> <p><tt><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> REPORT ON 'LORENZO WINDSOR': CASE #2</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewee:</strong> &quot;Bob&quot; (Name supplemented for anonymity); aged 62</tt></p> <hr /> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “So, you're one of the other witnesses of this&#8230; Lorenzo entity?”</p> <p>Bob: “He was not <em>just</em> an entity.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “&#8230; Uh, sorry, what did you just say?”</p> <p>Bob: “L-Listen to me, officer. These things, entities, erm- whatever you want to call them&#8212; They were <em>not</em> to be trifled with. I saw what this thing was able to do, the amount of stuff he knew about me, it was creepy as hell. As if he was some&#8230; god. It was weird&#8230; His aura&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Mhm-hm, was it the same man as what everyone else told us about?”</p> <p>Bob: “No, no, he was not&#8212; He looked really weird, like his entire face was glitching and loading like a black screen&#8212; He had this weird crown, a-and he did not have a mouth, like, none at all, but he spoke anyway, and I have to tell you <em>right fucking now</em>, we should delete everything we know about this guy.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “We cannot do that, Bob.”</p> <p>Bob: “&#8230; He didn't have a face. He&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “He&#8230; what&#8230;?”</p> <p><em>Bob seemed anxious.</em></p> <p>Bob: “&#8230; He didn't have a face. He wore white clothes, but he had no face.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “What do you mean by 'no face', Bob? Like a faceli&#8212;”</p> <p>Bob: “He had no face! It was all a <em>void</em>! S-Staring at me, staring&#8230; at&#8230; me&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “&#8230; Did he&#8230; tell you anything?”</p> <p><em>Bob begins to cry.</em></p> <p>Bob: “I was told to forget what happened to my wife, as the pain may be too unbearable for me.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “&#8230; Anything else?”</p> <p><em>Bob began to shake.</em></p> <p>Bob: “I-I stared. I stared into the ravine which was his face. I can never go back.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “&#8230; Where, Bob? To where?”</p> <p>Bob: “I want my dearest Masha. Please, give her back to me&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Was Masha your wife, Bob? What&#8230; happened to her?”</p> <p><em>Bob did not respond. After that event, Bob was rendered mute and was sent to therapy.</em></p> <hr /> <p>Conclusion: Bob's brain scans revealed a very rapid onset of cognitive decline. Moreover, further tests showed signs for a possible diagnosis of dementia, as evidenced by unnatural and abrupt atrophy in his frontal lobe and hippocampal area.</p> </div> <div class="blockquote"> <p><tt><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> REPORT ON 'LORENZO WINDSOR': CASE #3</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer</tt><br /> <tt><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dorothy Wells; aged 22</tt></p> <hr /> <p>Dorothy: “Hi.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Hello, Dorothy. Are you able to recount your encounter?”</p> <p><em>Dorothy shivered and nodded.</em></p> <p>Dorothy: “He told me his name was Lorenzo. He had this&#8230; weird crown on&#8230;”</p> <p><em>She took a deep breath.</em></p> <p>Dorothy: “I didn't look into his eyes. He didn't want me to.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “What did he look like?”</p> <p>Dorothy: “He was like a man, but there was something wrong with him. And he had some&#8230; <em>dread</em>&#8230;”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “Describe it.”</p> <p>Dorothy: “Scary. Like he's staring at my soul through the lens of my past. He knew my mother. He said she abandoned me when I was seven. I didn't remember having met her at all.”</p> <p>M.E.G. Officer: “What else did Lorenzo mention?”</p> <p>Dorothy: “I- I&#8230; I didn't remember. I just&#8230; I just knew I need to keep living on.”</p> <hr /> <p>Conclusion: Due to the encounter with Lorenzo, Dorothy temporarily developed false memories of her past. Although Ms. Wells never experienced anything serious, she often drew images of the entity. However, most of them were thrown to the fire by Dorothy herself after slowly recovering from the event.</p> <p>She is currently taking therapy and is doing well under the care of the M.E.G.</p> </div> </div> <div class="styled-quote"> <h2><span><span class="material-icons">psychology</span>Behaviors</span></h2> <p>Although knowledge pertaining to Lorenzo is still widely unknown, he has been reported to act calm, quiet, and asocial, showing intense aversion towards any form of touch and eye contact, as anyone who would stare directly into his eyes may experience the effects of (or something similar to) <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-43">Phenomenon 43</a>. <em>It seems as if he does not want any mortal to experience these effects, hence his avoidance. It is unclear if he is able to control it.</em></p> <p>He has been reported to have the ability to consume food, as evidenced by one of the interviews with &quot;Alex&quot;. Whether he needs this to survive or not is up for debate.</p> <p>Furthermore, according to witnesses, Lorenzo has been quite helpful, oftentimes assisting people in near states of amnesia remember their past to give them the vigor to keep going on. A common theory among wanderers who have encountered him suggests that he might either be doing this out of his own free will, or that he feels a strong or certain need to. Reports suggest that he is especially docile to children to whom he would seldomly hum a few songs. He would do so while staring at the floor or somewhere else in a dissociative, idle state, reminiscing about something of which is still unspecified.</p> </div> </div> <hr /> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Lorenzo<br /> <strong>Author:</strong> ally_charnutz<br /> <strong>License:</strong> CC-BY-SA-4.0</p> </blockquote> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ally-charnutz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7849084&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713088" alt="ally_charnutz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7849084)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ally-charnutz" >ally_charnutz</a></span></p>

&lt;th&gt;Maria depicted alongside &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-alchemist&quot;&gt;the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. Photography is made difficult by Maria&#039;s behavior.&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;child faceling&lt;/a&gt; with olive skin and dark brown hair. She possesses one brown left eye and half of a mouth on the left side of her face. Maria is often seen wearing a purple shirt with off-white arm sleeves, worn-out dirtied jeans, and a pair of velcro sneakers. She is usually seen with a pair of laboratory goggles, typically either wrapped around her neck or stationed on top of her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;science&lt;/span&gt;Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria has the same anatomy as most child facelings, though is observed to possess myopia and a lack of depth perception. Her facial structure suggests an underdeveloped right eye buried underneath her skin. She stands at a height of 4&#039;2 and weighs 55 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, sightings of Maria have been scarce. She was first witnessed following wanderers from a safe distance, before wanderers then began reporting her more unique behaviors (see: Behaviors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW:&lt;/strong&gt; INVESTIGATION INTO P.O.I. &#039;MARIA&#039;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; M.E.G. Officer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; Anonymous Wanderer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Could you tell me again what you witnessed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderer: “Yeah, yeah, you need it for the logs. Whatever. I was just minding my business when I felt something watching me. And no matter where I went it just wouldn’t leave. After an hour I finally saw it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “What did you see?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderer: “This&amp;#8230;kid, this fucking kid. I thought it was just some brat, but no. It peeked out from behind a corner, and I’m telling you, it only had one eye and the damn thing was staring right at me. I swear the kid was fucking following me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Are you sure it wasn’t just a faceling child?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderer: “No, those kids are harmless, this one was smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “I see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderer: “As soon as I saw it, I ran. I wasn’t about to stay and check if it was hostile or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.E.G. Officer: “Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderer: “No problem. Just tell me when you get rid of it, yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria has been observed seeking out several entities commonly associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lost&quot;&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt; as a sort of messenger for the Alchemist. After questioning, this was confirmed by the Alchemist himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW:&lt;/strong&gt; FURTHER QUESTIONING RE: POI &#039;MARIA&#039;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; Paula Irving&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interviewee:&lt;/strong&gt; The Alchemist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: &amp;quot;Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: “Of course, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: “So, Alchemist, we&#039;ve heard rumors about Maria?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: &amp;quot;Oh, her? Curious little thing, isn’t she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: &amp;quot;Could you state your relation to her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: &amp;quot;I&#039;m her &#039;science uncle&#039;. That&#039;s not the same as a normal uncle, now don&#039;t you ever forget that! It doesn&#039;t come with all the same responsibilities of being an uncle-uncle, you see&amp;#8230; she really is capable of being left alone now anyhow. She&#039;s more like a&amp;#8230; research associate, than anything else. Unpaid intern?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: &amp;quot;Interesting, interesting. May I ask about the goggles she wears? I assume those came from you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: &amp;quot;Indeed! I gave her those, lets her see the details of things much clearer, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: &amp;quot;I see. For clarification, you are not related to Maria biologically in any way?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: &amp;quot;No, no, not related at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: “That’s about all the time I have today, thank you for this interview, Alchemist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: “Of course. Now, how about my payment?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula: “Your payment?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemist: “Oh, did you think this little interview was for free? No, no, information is still a product that requires a fair trade. It’s about time I collect what is due.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;psychology&lt;/span&gt;Behaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria frequently shows curiosity towards humans, often following wanderers to merely observe them. It is not uncommon for her to rummage through the belongings of humans, although it has been noted that she never takes anything. Instead, she may prank them, with wanderers waking to find writing on their faces or with their belongings stacked in tower-like structures. Along with this, she has been observed pickpocketing wanderers, although she has never been seen keeping anything she finds, returning the items after she is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria has been observed to have a lack of self-preservation at times, having been seen often holding sharp objects close to her face in order to get a better look at them. Although she is not known to have exhibited aggression towards humans, caution is nonetheless advised, as child facelings are known to throw tantrums and scratch in self defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to food, Maria seems to hate citrus flavored items, but loves sweet-tasting things. Offering her the latter has resulted in Maria helping in exchange, whether it be finding an exit or locating helpful resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria has demonstrated a strong aversion to balloons. Her own explanation for this phobia is that she hates the sound of popping balloons, as well as the squeaking sound caused by rubbing them. It is theorized that the true source of her fear stems from an encounter with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-67&quot;&gt;partygoer&lt;/a&gt;, though this remains unconfirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;styled-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;camera&lt;/span&gt;Gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been instances where wanderers run into notes that warn them of nearby dangers, such as an entities lurking nearby or environmental hazards. These drawings are confirmed to have been made by Maria. A few images of her drawings can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:maria/maria-clump.png&quot; alt=&quot;maria-clump.png&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:maria/maria-me.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;maria-me.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:maria/maria-hound.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;maria-hound.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:maria/maria-smiler.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;maria-smiler.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/backrooms/images/d/db/Maria_Yummy_Snack_Featuring_Keymaster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maria_Yummy_Snack_Featuring_Keymaster.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/backrooms/images/b/bc/Maria_Level_592_Warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maria_Level_592_Warning.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/backrooms/images/0/08/Maria_Level_131_Warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maria_Level_131_Warning.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/backrooms/images/7/7b/One_Half_of_a_Conversation_with_Maria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One_Half_of_a_Conversation_with_Maria.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;Relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-alchemist&quot;&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;: Maria is close to the Alchemist. Other than her sign name for him, that has been roughly translated to “All”, she has been observed calling him “Grandfather” or “Uncle”. It has been confirmed that they are not biologically related, but Maria seems to have a familial bond with Alchemist regardless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-103&quot;&gt;The Keymaster&lt;/a&gt;: Maria likes to watch the Keymaster from a distance. She has mentioned in an interview that she finds his confusion funny and that she wishes that he would not disappear when he goes unconscious. This is due to the fact that she would like to prank him one day while he is asleep. She is also in possession of an unknown Level Key, but after questioning, she seems to not know where it leads to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-220&quot;&gt;The Catmaster&lt;/a&gt;: Maria has been seen following Catmaster around whenever their paths cross, often staying a few paces behind him rather than keeping a reasonable distance between them. She has been seen attempting to pick him up more than once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-140&quot;&gt;Lady Blanche&lt;/a&gt;: While Maria respects Lady Blanche, she has described her as “no fun” and expressed a dislike of formal etiquette, claiming that she sees no point in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-74&quot;&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt;: Maria has expressed curiosity in Argos’ judgement towards laws, but says that the Alchemist has told her not to bother him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-59&quot;&gt;Philia&lt;/a&gt;: Maria often visits Philia and brings her small gifts. She enjoys being around her and when asked, she describes her as a very kind woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;Relevant Tales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;tt&gt;None thus far.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wood-frame&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three thousand years ago, this was quite the lively spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Level 437&lt;/strong&gt; was a temple dedicated to Tsovaeith, Lord of Grace, Avatar of goodwill. Tsovaeith proclaimed xemself to be the bearer of all kindness, all that was good in the world. And xey spoke truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions flocked to xyr temple, seeking absolution and contentment. Great artists built upon the level&#039;s humble framework, leaving elegant sculptures and delicate stained glass windows scattered throughout the soaring marble architecture. A garden was planted in the central clearing, flourishing with beautiful flowers and delectable crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsovaeith presided over a five-hundred-year era of peace, harmony, and good fortune. The Backrooms reverberated with an echo of true happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most calamities, it came about as a result of good intentions. Eardwulf Akermane, Tsovaeith&#039;s Champion, had ventured out to seek gifts for his master. Tsovaeith had arranged a feast for the temple&#039;s inhabitants to celebrate their prosperity, and Eardwulf needed to provide food and drink. For this task, he was given the seat of honor at the banquet, as Tsovaeith made a point of uplifting others instead of dwelling on xyr own glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festivities were well underway when Tsovaeith ran out of wine. Xey did not realize that xey had run out of wine, but xey had run out of wine nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the feast started, Eardwulf had brought xem an ornate wine glass from &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-87&quot;&gt;Level 87&lt;/a&gt;. It was masterfully crafted, embellished with diamonds and engraved with a mysterious text &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-allseer&quot;&gt;The Allseer&lt;/a&gt; claimed was gibberish. Tsovaeith was greatly impressed with it, and had commended him for his great discovery. Xey had promptly claimed it as xyr own glass for the evening, claiming that it had too much love put into it to be locked away in some stuffy cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Tsovaeith did not realize that xey had run out of wine, they went to take a drink from the empty glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-59&quot;&gt;the glass drank from xem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in &lt;strong&gt;Level 437&lt;/strong&gt; had their guard down. Why wouldn&#039;t they? The temple was a place of absolute peace and safety. As such, when the glass cogs of time summoned a false idol from an era long past, nobody was prepared to defend their monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsovaeith was killed. Without xem, Eardwulf lost his connection to the divine, and he was slain as well. Some of the level&#039;s occupants managed to escape, but not many. When the dust settled, the walls were coated in blood, and the domain of the Lord of Grace was obliterated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three thousand years, &lt;strong&gt;Level 437&lt;/strong&gt; has been abandoned. The temple is empty. Everything, save the barest foundations, have been razed to the ground. Beauty can no longer be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Tsovaeith&#039;s influence, avarice and envy have woven themselves into every thought and action in this world. Reality bears no kindness for us, and those who make their own goodwill cannot compete against the never-ending flow of pure scorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in your life, you may have wondered why bad things happen to good people. Now you have your answer.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Let The Blade Drink Deeper</title>
				<link>http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/let-the-blade-drink-deeper</link>
				<description>


&lt;p&gt;Davriel&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Tachi&lt;/em&gt; felt light in his hands as he turned to the mess around him. The curved blade, thin and serrated, was soaked in blood. He hadn&#039;t meant to do that, yet it didn&#039;t really matter. The damned blade hadn&#039;t been fed for too long. Davriel straightened the sword, watching the red sink into the black metal, and slid it into its sheath. He would have to clean it later. He walked over the corpses, sighing as these new lives weighed on his conscience. Despite the reward, he still had trouble paying the price at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing his morality aside, he walked further into the level. He wasn&#039;t sure which level he was in, probably twelve, but the strange halls unnerved him nonetheless. He took a hearty sip of almond water to ground himself, a reminder of his own existence. He gripped his sword tighter, breathing heavily. The death weighed on him just as much as the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He felt the sword vibrate against his waist. Pulling it from its sheath again, he looked down at the blade&amp;#8230; Crimson &lt;em&gt;Kanji&lt;/em&gt; trickled down its black surface. Davriel read the lettering and frowned. Did Aklavos seriously expect him to just walk into a M.E.G outpost and kill one of the department heads? Whoever led team &amp;quot;Trial Testers&amp;quot; wouldn&#039;t be undefended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m not that daft, Aklavos. If you&#039;re trying to kill me, you&#039;ll have to try harder.&amp;quot; As he spoke, the blade vibrated angrily, then the words disappeared from its metals. Slowly, new ones took its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel below and find the mask. Deep below zero lies your task.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He blinked at the text and narrowed his eyes. The sword was surely trying to kill him now. Additionally, it was doing a terrible job of rhyming. Davriel glared at it and pondered. The damned blade had offered him a life for each one he was willing to take. Thanks to his already loose morals, he had accepted. And now it wanted him to wear a mask. Davriel pulled up his phone and maneuvered through the database, eventually finding what he assumed the blade spoke of. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Object 24&lt;/a&gt;. The wall masks. After a cursory read, he looked back down at Aklavos. He weighed the pros and cons. The mask should be helpful, and the downsides weren&#039;t anything he wasn&#039;t already doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed and brandished Aklavos. This wouldn&#039;t be too bad. The journey from anywhere to zero was easy enough with it. He slashed through the metal wall, revealing an empty black void behind the white steel. As the Tachi slid through the wall, he felt a stinging pain in his arm. Aklavos was feeding on him. He cursed at the pain, grimacing. Despite the mass of souls it had devoured, it still hungered. He would have to be careful while using the blade, lest his soul be next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked through the new cut in the wall, black enveloping him for a second before he fell through a manilla ceiling light into level zero. He grimaced at his blade, pain throbbing in his wrist. Aklavos was already hungry again. He took the sword up again and used the hilt to try and crack the wall. Instead of hitting, the hilt went through, his hand following, then the rest of his body as he noclipped through the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fell out into a achromatic hall. He looked ahead through the ominous distance. He just needed to find a mask. He started his trek, sheathing his &lt;em&gt;tachi&lt;/em&gt;. As he walked, he looked up the level he was in. After some searching and matching results, he came to &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0-4&quot;&gt;Level 0.4&lt;/a&gt;. Since the level used to be negative, it was &#039;below zero&#039;, so to speak. The wifi was choppy, the lack of windows making it difficult to connect. Every once in a while it would cut off. Apparently the doors would clip him into &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-331&quot;&gt;Level 331&lt;/a&gt;. He would avoid it if he could. After maybe a mile of walking, he started hearing piano notes. He looked through his phone downloads and started playing heavy metal, hating the sound of slow unorganized piano. He saw two people in the distance. He stopped. The blade vibrated. He unsheathed his weapon and quickened his pace towards them, his heart thumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;color&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left the bodies behind, grimacing. Slowly, he saw the static overcome his sight. Black and white colored his vision. He had a basic understanding of the level thanks to the database entry, but reading and experiencing something were quite different. He still saw no masks, just the endless white and black doors. He hoped the mask wouldn&#039;t be in the level beneath. That would be a much more imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked, his music chopped off. He looked at his phone. The text was too small and the static was too great. He would have to go without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piano was accompanied with the sounds of smooth jazz. A mobsters voice echoed, the voice filtered as if through a radio. The voice said something or another about karma, but Davriel ignored it. He didn&#039;t need more weight on his mind than there already was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed, seeing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in the distance. He had no idea if it was a serious threat or not, and couldn&#039;t take the risk. If his blade suddenly got violent, he might end up instigating a fight he couldn&#039;t win. He sighed and looked at the door to his side. He turned the knob and walked through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;color&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level reeked of corpses and mildew. The basement was dilapidated and ruined, water filling the lower half. He listened closely, bringing his phone up and turning on the flashlight. Almost five feet away stood a tall, lanky humanoid figure with an unnatural smile. In less than a second, he pulled his blade to position and prepared. Within the blink for an eye, the entity appeared a foot behind him. Davriel twisted towards it, then slammed his blade down.&lt;br /&gt;
He missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A horrible burning sensation filled Davriel&#039;s head as it smiled at him. Davriel averted his eyes and slashed. He heard an inhumane, agonizing screech as his &lt;em&gt;tachi&lt;/em&gt; sunk into its skin. The sound grated against him, a scream reminiscent of previous victims. He was glad this wasn&#039;t human. He twisted his blade before pulling it out, using the momentum to pull the thing with it. The sword flipped in his hand, the hilt slamming forth into the being&#039;s face. Then, he took a heavy swing at the being. The entity shed no blood as its head fell from its body. Aklavos vibrated, hungry for a soul that this thing lacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel kept the weapon out, fully expecting more of them. He looked around, seeing a deeper pool past the door in front of him with a light near the end. The way opposite led through a shallow part with multiple doorways that faded to complete darkness. Having no solutions for dealing with smilers, he had to go for the light. His steps were quite loud in the water, and he feared he may be attracting more entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made it to another doorway, seeing a flashlight a room away. He heard someone talking. Someones? Multiple people. He cautiously walked through. M.E.G agents? If so, it would be a relatively clean kill. He peeked around a corner. Five people. Three of them wore masks, and the other two were gagged and tied. A crate was in the room&#039;s center, a lantern and Glock lying upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the wearers wielded guns. The other held a knife and was holding it to one of the gagged members throat. She was wearing a volto mask. The mask looked quite dull, a white player split into two sections conjoined in the center with red paint. A circle around the eyes was embossed with what looked to be golden wax. Perhaps fancy to some, but it looked&amp;#8230; Colorless, to Davriel. White with a spray of red and gold. She took one of the captives gags off, and her blade sunk lightly into his skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We didn&#039;t want to do this, but you leave no choice. Where are you keeping the stock of masks?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I won&#039;t&amp;#8230; I can&#039;t answer that.&amp;quot; The captive replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then we&#039;ll have to kill your friend here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel slid into the room, behind the first wearer, a arlecchino wearer clad in black. The Volto wearer opened her mouth to warn the man&amp;#8230; But a stab through the spine did the trick. The man fell dead, arlecchino mask falling off his face into the murky water. It sunk down, blood staining the water&#039;s surface. Suddenly, another one of the entities appeared, not dissimilar from the one that attacked him earlier. It smiled at one of the captives, who tried to scream through her gag. It was futile. It wrapped its arms around her, and they both disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#039;t matter much. It just made his job easier. The other woman, wearing a blue and black kitsune mask, jumped back from where the entity had appeared. She was facing away from him, yet expertly dodged aside from his slash. She was out of reach. She sighed with relief as the entity disappeared, then turned to Davriel. She pulled the gun up, aiming for his head, and shot. He flinched, but the gun jammed. He wouldn&#039;t let the opportunity go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a step back, and Davriel dashed forward, a slashing leap. A bullet flew from the side, and skimmed Davriel&#039;s shoulder. He stopped, glancing aside, and the Kitsune wearer leaped back again, trying to fix her gun. Davriel threw the blade at her as she was paying attention to her pistol, and it pierced through, stabbing through the middle of her chest. The body sunk down into the water. He turned to the person with the volto mask, and felt another bullet pierce his knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shit, No!&amp;quot; Her curse was paramount to a shout, and he felt his morals shake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her gun dropped, empty of rounds.His hesitation was cut short as he felt Aklavos stabbing into his mind. He grabbed Aklavos, then started stalking towards her. A few feet away, a captive frantically looked between him and her. With a quick stab, Davriel&#039;s blade took the prisoner&#039;s life. He brandished his sword at the mask wearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;ll give you one chance. I need a mask. Give me one and I&#039;ll let you live,&amp;quot; he threatened. He let the lie fall. She could likely jump back quicker then he could attack, so it would be quicker if she just handed him the mask and he stabbed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#8230; just take the ones on the floor!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&#039;t think I will. The one on your face. Remove it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;d rather not,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; She said, her voice suddenly deeper, sharper. She lithely leaped back up, and Davriel slashed down. She barely avoided the hit and with a lunge, an explosive burst of speed and pain, her dagger stabbed into his heart. He looked down at the wound and frowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Think twice before you mess with a maiden,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davriel narrowed his eyes. &amp;quot;I don&#039;t have the luxury of thinking twice. That&#039;s this one&#039;s job. How many lives do I have left?&amp;quot; he asked out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His blade shone a brilliant blue, and crimson splotches wrote out the number thirty three. The light slowly fades into black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What? How?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; She asked. Her eyes were wide behind the mask, and he remembered the first time someone tried to kill him. No matter. This would end here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;m not so good at dying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hand shot out. He grabbed her throat in one hand, dropped his blade, and grabbed her wrist in the other. With a painful crunch, her wrist was broken. He ripped her mask off, her body freezing like a deer in headlights. He casually picked up Aklavos, the blade shaking in anticipation. Davriel put the tip of his sword to her heart. Then he ran her through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pulled Aklavos up with a sickening lurch, and the woman slumped into the water. He looked at the Volto mask. He supposed he would have to wear it anyway. He glared one more time, at the mask, then the sword. He raised the mask and attached the bloody prize to his face. His blade stilled, heavy with souls. He felt a headache start to form, as throbbing pain echoed throughout his skull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Can Speak Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>Davriel's <em>Tachi</em> felt light in his hands as he turned to the mess around him. The curved blade, thin and serrated, was soaked in blood. He hadn't meant to do that, yet it didn't really matter. The damned blade hadn't been fed for too long. Davriel straightened the sword, watching the red sink into the black metal, and slid it into its sheath. He would have to clean it later. He walked over the corpses, sighing as these new lives weighed on his conscience. Despite the reward, he still had trouble paying the price at times.</p> <p>Pushing his morality aside, he walked further into the level. He wasn't sure which level he was in, probably twelve, but the strange halls unnerved him nonetheless. He took a hearty sip of almond water to ground himself, a reminder of his own existence. He gripped his sword tighter, breathing heavily. The death weighed on him just as much as the level.</p> <p>He felt the sword vibrate against his waist. Pulling it from its sheath again, he looked down at the blade&#8230; Crimson <em>Kanji</em> trickled down its black surface. Davriel read the lettering and frowned. Did Aklavos seriously expect him to just walk into a M.E.G outpost and kill one of the department heads? Whoever led team &quot;Trial Testers&quot; wouldn't be undefended.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not that daft, Aklavos. If you're trying to kill me, you'll have to try harder.&quot; As he spoke, the blade vibrated angrily, then the words disappeared from its metals. Slowly, new ones took its place.</p> <p><em>Travel below and find the mask. Deep below zero lies your task.</em></p> <p>He blinked at the text and narrowed his eyes. The sword was surely trying to kill him now. Additionally, it was doing a terrible job of rhyming. Davriel glared at it and pondered. The damned blade had offered him a life for each one he was willing to take. Thanks to his already loose morals, he had accepted. And now it wanted him to wear a mask. Davriel pulled up his phone and maneuvered through the database, eventually finding what he assumed the blade spoke of. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a>. The wall masks. After a cursory read, he looked back down at Aklavos. He weighed the pros and cons. The mask should be helpful, and the downsides weren't anything he wasn't already doing.</p> <p>He sighed and brandished Aklavos. This wouldn't be too bad. The journey from anywhere to zero was easy enough with it. He slashed through the metal wall, revealing an empty black void behind the white steel. As the Tachi slid through the wall, he felt a stinging pain in his arm. Aklavos was feeding on him. He cursed at the pain, grimacing. Despite the mass of souls it had devoured, it still hungered. He would have to be careful while using the blade, lest his soul be next.</p> <p>He walked through the new cut in the wall, black enveloping him for a second before he fell through a manilla ceiling light into level zero. He grimaced at his blade, pain throbbing in his wrist. Aklavos was already hungry again. He took the sword up again and used the hilt to try and crack the wall. Instead of hitting, the hilt went through, his hand following, then the rest of his body as he noclipped through the wall.<br /></p> <table class="hrContainer hrThreeDiamonds" style="margin: 0 auto;"> <tr> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> </tr> </table> <p>He fell out into a achromatic hall. He looked ahead through the ominous distance. He just needed to find a mask. He started his trek, sheathing his <em>tachi</em>. As he walked, he looked up the level he was in. After some searching and matching results, he came to <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0-4">Level 0.4</a>. Since the level used to be negative, it was 'below zero', so to speak. The wifi was choppy, the lack of windows making it difficult to connect. Every once in a while it would cut off. Apparently the doors would clip him into <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-331">Level 331</a>. He would avoid it if he could. After maybe a mile of walking, he started hearing piano notes. He looked through his phone downloads and started playing heavy metal, hating the sound of slow unorganized piano. He saw two people in the distance. He stopped. The blade vibrated. He unsheathed his weapon and quickened his pace towards them, his heart thumping.<br /></p> <table class="hrContainer hrThreeDiamonds" style="margin: 0 auto;"> <tr> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> </tr> </table> <p>He left the bodies behind, grimacing. Slowly, he saw the static overcome his sight. Black and white colored his vision. He had a basic understanding of the level thanks to the database entry, but reading and experiencing something were quite different. He still saw no masks, just the endless white and black doors. He hoped the mask wouldn't be in the level beneath. That would be a much more imminent danger.</p> <p>As he walked, his music chopped off. He looked at his phone. The text was too small and the static was too great. He would have to go without it.</p> <p>The piano was accompanied with the sounds of smooth jazz. A mobsters voice echoed, the voice filtered as if through a radio. The voice said something or another about karma, but Davriel ignored it. He didn't need more weight on his mind than there already was.</p> <p>He sighed, seeing <em>something</em> in the distance. He had no idea if it was a serious threat or not, and couldn't take the risk. If his blade suddenly got violent, he might end up instigating a fight he couldn't win. He sighed and looked at the door to his side. He turned the knob and walked through.<br /></p> <table class="hrContainer hrThreeDiamonds" style="margin: 0 auto;"> <tr> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> <td> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 7px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 5px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 3px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> <div class="color" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; width: 1px; margin: 0 auto;"></div> </td> </tr> </table> <p>The level reeked of corpses and mildew. The basement was dilapidated and ruined, water filling the lower half. He listened closely, bringing his phone up and turning on the flashlight. Almost five feet away stood a tall, lanky humanoid figure with an unnatural smile. In less than a second, he pulled his blade to position and prepared. Within the blink for an eye, the entity appeared a foot behind him. Davriel twisted towards it, then slammed his blade down.<br /> He missed.</p> <p>A horrible burning sensation filled Davriel's head as it smiled at him. Davriel averted his eyes and slashed. He heard an inhumane, agonizing screech as his <em>tachi</em> sunk into its skin. The sound grated against him, a scream reminiscent of previous victims. He was glad this wasn't human. He twisted his blade before pulling it out, using the momentum to pull the thing with it. The sword flipped in his hand, the hilt slamming forth into the being's face. Then, he took a heavy swing at the being. The entity shed no blood as its head fell from its body. Aklavos vibrated, hungry for a soul that this thing lacked.</p> <p>Davriel kept the weapon out, fully expecting more of them. He looked around, seeing a deeper pool past the door in front of him with a light near the end. The way opposite led through a shallow part with multiple doorways that faded to complete darkness. Having no solutions for dealing with smilers, he had to go for the light. His steps were quite loud in the water, and he feared he may be attracting more entities.</p> <p>He made it to another doorway, seeing a flashlight a room away. He heard someone talking. Someones? Multiple people. He cautiously walked through. M.E.G agents? If so, it would be a relatively clean kill. He peeked around a corner. Five people. Three of them wore masks, and the other two were gagged and tied. A crate was in the room's center, a lantern and Glock lying upon it.</p> <p>Two of the wearers wielded guns. The other held a knife and was holding it to one of the gagged members throat. She was wearing a volto mask. The mask looked quite dull, a white player split into two sections conjoined in the center with red paint. A circle around the eyes was embossed with what looked to be golden wax. Perhaps fancy to some, but it looked&#8230; Colorless, to Davriel. White with a spray of red and gold. She took one of the captives gags off, and her blade sunk lightly into his skin.</p> <p>&quot;We didn't want to do this, but you leave no choice. Where are you keeping the stock of masks?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I won't&#8230; I can't answer that.&quot; The captive replied.</p> <p>&quot;Then we'll have to kill your friend here.&quot;</p> <p>Davriel slid into the room, behind the first wearer, a arlecchino wearer clad in black. The Volto wearer opened her mouth to warn the man&#8230; But a stab through the spine did the trick. The man fell dead, arlecchino mask falling off his face into the murky water. It sunk down, blood staining the water's surface. Suddenly, another one of the entities appeared, not dissimilar from the one that attacked him earlier. It smiled at one of the captives, who tried to scream through her gag. It was futile. It wrapped its arms around her, and they both disappeared.</p> <p>Didn't matter much. It just made his job easier. The other woman, wearing a blue and black kitsune mask, jumped back from where the entity had appeared. She was facing away from him, yet expertly dodged aside from his slash. She was out of reach. She sighed with relief as the entity disappeared, then turned to Davriel. She pulled the gun up, aiming for his head, and shot. He flinched, but the gun jammed. He wouldn't let the opportunity go to waste.</p> <p>She took a step back, and Davriel dashed forward, a slashing leap. A bullet flew from the side, and skimmed Davriel's shoulder. He stopped, glancing aside, and the Kitsune wearer leaped back again, trying to fix her gun. Davriel threw the blade at her as she was paying attention to her pistol, and it pierced through, stabbing through the middle of her chest. The body sunk down into the water. He turned to the person with the volto mask, and felt another bullet pierce his knee.</p> <p>&quot;Shit, No!&quot; Her curse was paramount to a shout, and he felt his morals shake.</p> <p>Her gun dropped, empty of rounds.His hesitation was cut short as he felt Aklavos stabbing into his mind. He grabbed Aklavos, then started stalking towards her. A few feet away, a captive frantically looked between him and her. With a quick stab, Davriel's blade took the prisoner's life. He brandished his sword at the mask wearer.</p> <p>&quot;I'll give you one chance. I need a mask. Give me one and I'll let you live,&quot; he threatened. He let the lie fall. She could likely jump back quicker then he could attack, so it would be quicker if she just handed him the mask and he stabbed her.</p> <p>&quot;I&#8230; just take the ones on the floor!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don't think I will. The one on your face. Remove it.&quot;</p> <p><em>&quot;I'd rather not,&quot;</em> She said, her voice suddenly deeper, sharper. She lithely leaped back up, and Davriel slashed down. She barely avoided the hit and with a lunge, an explosive burst of speed and pain, her dagger stabbed into his heart. He looked down at the wound and frowned.</p> <p><em>&quot;Think twice before you mess with a maiden,&quot;</em> she said.</p> <p>Davriel narrowed his eyes. &quot;I don't have the luxury of thinking twice. That's this one's job. How many lives do I have left?&quot; he asked out loud.</p> <p>His blade shone a brilliant blue, and crimson splotches wrote out the number thirty three. The light slowly fades into black.</p> <p>&quot;<em>What? How?</em>&quot; She asked. Her eyes were wide behind the mask, and he remembered the first time someone tried to kill him. No matter. This would end here.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not so good at dying.&quot;</p> <p>His hand shot out. He grabbed her throat in one hand, dropped his blade, and grabbed her wrist in the other. With a painful crunch, her wrist was broken. He ripped her mask off, her body freezing like a deer in headlights. He casually picked up Aklavos, the blade shaking in anticipation. Davriel put the tip of his sword to her heart. Then he ran her through.</p> <p>He pulled Aklavos up with a sickening lurch, and the woman slumped into the water. He looked at the Volto mask. He supposed he would have to wear it anyway. He glared one more time, at the mask, then the sword. He raised the mask and attached the bloody prize to his face. His blade stilled, heavy with souls. He felt a headache start to form, as throbbing pain echoed throughout his skull.</p> <p><span style="color: red"><em>I Can Speak Now.</em></span></p> <div style="text-align: center;"></div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kkitsunebi" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7888847&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713088" alt="KKitsunebi" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7888847)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kkitsunebi" >KKitsunebi</a></span></p>

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please come back later!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, brothers and sisters. I have been working hard to create a page on the ancient &lt;strong&gt;Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;, using the newly uncovered Canon book and the Octavians now stored @ the Archive. I am currently awaiting review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;datastart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:IPAE&quot;  &gt;ɔːl ˈsiːə&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon&quot;&gt;goddesses of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, well-known for her ability to see things clearer than any human. The cult of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; was largely formed by our ancient brothers in reverence of her knowledge, which went farther than any possessed by humans, and in an attempt to learn more about the Backrooms. They built her a grand temple known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;the Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;, which stood tall until its corruption after the fall of the ancient Pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was credited by our ancient brothers for creating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;Faceless Ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appearance in Texts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; has appeared consistently in many pieces of ancient text. The main secondary text sources for &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Octavian Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Octavian Texts&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-1&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mention few details about &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;, though they do establish some basic traits which are consistent throughout later records. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Octavian Texts, &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has olive skin;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wears salmon pink garbs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has brown hair, and;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creates flower crowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panopticon was yet to be constructed during the time of the Octavian Text, and as such the worship of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; was primitive and undeveloped. There was but one monthly worship cycle involving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the killing of an owl, standing for the pursuit of knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the burying of the owl&#039;s eyes, standing for biology;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the making of arrows with the owl&#039;s feathers, standing for physics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally the cooking of the owl&#039;s meat, standing for chemistry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owl would not be eaten, but buried among a bed of flowers&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-2&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although it is not stated, it is presumed that the flowers that the owl would be buried among were the same as &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; would have used for her flower crowns. No detailed floral records of the ancient paradise of the time are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brother Bartholomew&#039;s Canon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother Bartholomew&#039;s &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:the-pillar-scripture&quot;&gt;divinely inspired&lt;/a&gt; Canon includes a book on &lt;strong&gt;The Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;, and is the most detailed account of her to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical description in the book of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; in Bartholomew&#039;s Canon lines up entirely with the version from the Octavian Texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Symbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canon likens &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cats&lt;/strong&gt;, for being &lt;strong&gt;wise&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owls&lt;/strong&gt;, for being &lt;strong&gt;all-seeing&lt;/strong&gt; (this refers to some owls&#039; ability to rotate their heads 270 degrees);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willow Tree&lt;/strong&gt;, for being &lt;strong&gt;wise&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;far-reaching&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no mentions of the earlier religious rites described in the Octavian Texts for &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; in her book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; set out the earliest plans and justifications for the building of the Panopticon, and is our main source for its internal structure. It sets out the idea for the temple as a ring-shaped garden with a tower in the middle from which all of the garden can be observed. The garden was supposed to have three levels, stacked atop each other&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-3&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, all visible from the central tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This garden would host religious rites and festivals. The book does not speak of any festivals in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to her death, worship of the Allseer was not present in any further writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Relationships with Others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Humans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of human subjugation to the gods of the Pantheon, the relationships between humans and gods were few and far between. That being said, &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; does seem to have cared deeply for humans, and been more on the side of self-determination and freedom for the human population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nunca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story recounts the relationship between Nunca and &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;. She refers to Nunca more formally than other characters, showing a unique respect for him. This respect was reciprocal, Nunca having shared a close friendship with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their friendship ended following a revelation of her vision of the future, specifically that Nunca would soon die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Allseer knew on that day that she could no longer keep this a secret. Flowers on her head wilted, eyes unobscured and uncovered&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-4&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, she approached him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My brother Nunca,&amp;quot; asked she, &amp;quot;May we speak privately?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot; he proclaimed. &amp;quot;Talk to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two ventured to the top of the highest peak in the village, where few ventured. Paths would never be beaten there before the village&#039;s end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My visions these past days have troubled me, as you know. One such vision concerns you, brother Nunca.&amp;quot; she revealed to him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Me?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Soon, you will see the day of your own destruction. Light of the sky and of laughter will be too much for your eyes. We can do nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence rang out. The peak&#039;s rickety willow calmed its rustling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#8230;Thank you for telling me, I suppose. Do you know when?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You have but a month, brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other notable relation of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&#039;s&lt;/strong&gt;, Philia knew her well. She was her primary confidant, not willing to burden Nunca with her worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s magnificent.&amp;quot; she&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-5&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; said, stepping back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their statue had been as beautiful as they had imagined. The flower crown was then laid upon her head as a final touch — solidifying its reality for the two of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Philia, sister of mine&amp;#8230; may we take a break from our labours? To speak, I mean.&amp;quot; asked the Allseer, less than concerned with the sculpture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh? Do go on, you know I will always remain here for you, sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Allseer had always pitied Philia somewhat. She sensed betrayals in her future, yet saw her unequipped to handle them — a friend all too willing to bear the weight of a wolf leaning upon her for support, even as its claws dug into her. It appeared she would need to avail of this, though the very thought troubled her deeply. It mattered none at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It is about&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist&quot;&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Philia had been warned of the upcoming massacre, she had been sworn to secrecy. It is unknown if she confronted the bastard Greyking or not, though this is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Pantheon often sought insight from &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt;, asking her questions to varying degrees of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final story written about &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; was an exchange between &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-keymaster/offset/2&quot;&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; and her for this exact purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last human squirmed through the door, and the two were finally alone. The master of Access spoke hoarsely and carefully.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I ask for your insight once again, sister.&amp;quot; he coughed out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Go on, I have little time to entertain you.&amp;quot; she responded, with barely the energy to spend on this conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How do I assure the loyalty of my worshippers? I have been&amp;#8230; I am suspicious of them, I will admit.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was not the sort of question she had been hoping for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern Day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what happened to &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; following the original massacre. This is the period in which texts begin mentioning her more infrequently, and all artistic depictions originated prior to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was killed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist&quot;&gt;the Iron Fist&lt;/a&gt;. This has been boasted by them for many years. It is not known exactly how they managed to capture and murder her, given her foresight and knowledge&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-34424-6&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. According to them, she was one of the last to be killed of the original ancient Pantheon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indirect reincarnation of &lt;strong&gt;the Allseer&lt;/strong&gt; exists today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-alchemist&quot;&gt;the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. This occured 200 years ago, and is most likely related to her creation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;Faceless Ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; height: 0px; font-size: 1px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes-footer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Which have been relocated out of their original location in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-8&quot;&gt;Level 8&lt;/a&gt;, and are now available for reading in full at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-906&quot;&gt;Cygnus Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Though this rule may be broken in times of scarcity according to the text&#039;s instructions. This may have stood for the Allseer&#039;s kindness, though it is likely it was simply to conserve resources.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. The feasibility of this design has come into question as of recent, due to the lack of light reaching the lower levels.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. Original context unknown — likely not literal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;[Philia]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-footer&quot; id=&quot;footnote-34424-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot;  &gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Many theories suggest it was some sort of tradeoff for a chain of events in the future, though nothing is written on the subject.&lt;/div&gt;

The cult of <strong>the Allseer</strong> was largely formed by our ancient brothers in reverence of her knowledge, which went farther than any possessed by humans, and in an attempt to learn more about the Backrooms. They built her a grand temple known as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">the Panopticon</a>, which stood tall until its corruption after the fall of the ancient Pantheon.</p> <p>She was credited by our ancient brothers for creating the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9">Faceless Ones</a>.</p> <h1><span>Appearance in Texts</span></h1> <p><strong>The Allseer</strong> has appeared consistently in many pieces of ancient text. The main secondary text sources for <strong>the Allseer</strong> are:</p> <h2><span>Octavian Text</span></h2> <p>The Octavian Texts<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-1" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >1</a></sup> mention few details about <strong>the Allseer</strong>, though they do establish some basic traits which are consistent throughout later records. These are:</p> <h3><span>Physical Description</span></h3> <p>According to the Octavian Texts, <strong>the Allseer</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>has olive skin;</li> <li>wears salmon pink garbs;</li> <li>has brown hair, and;</li> <li>creates flower crowns.</li> </ul> <h3><span>Worship</span></h3> <p>The Panopticon was yet to be constructed during the time of the Octavian Text, and as such the worship of <strong>the Allseer</strong> was primitive and undeveloped. There was but one monthly worship cycle involving:</p> <ul> <li>the killing of an owl, standing for the pursuit of knowledge;</li> <li>the burying of the owl's eyes, standing for biology;</li> <li>the making of arrows with the owl's feathers, standing for physics;</li> <li>and finally the cooking of the owl's meat, standing for chemistry.</li> </ul> <p>The owl would not be eaten, but buried among a bed of flowers<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-2" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >2</a></sup>. Although it is not stated, it is presumed that the flowers that the owl would be buried among were the same as <strong>the Allseer</strong> would have used for her flower crowns. No detailed floral records of the ancient paradise of the time are available.</p> <h2><span>Brother Bartholomew's Canon</span></h2> <p>Brother Bartholomew's <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:the-pillar-scripture">divinely inspired</a> Canon includes a book on <strong>The Allseer</strong>, and is the most detailed account of her to survive.</p> <h3><span>Physical Description</span></h3> <p>The physical description in the book of <strong>the Allseer</strong> in Bartholomew's Canon lines up entirely with the version from the Octavian Texts.</p> <h3><span>Symbols</span></h3> <p>The Canon likens <strong>the Allseer</strong> to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cats</strong>, for being <strong>wise</strong>;</li> <li><strong>Owls</strong>, for being <strong>all-seeing</strong> (this refers to some owls' ability to rotate their heads 270 degrees);</li> <li><strong>Willow Tree</strong>, for being <strong>wise</strong> and <strong>far-reaching</strong>.</li> </ul> <h3><span>Worship</span></h3> <p>There are no mentions of the earlier religious rites described in the Octavian Texts for <strong>the Allseer</strong> in her book.</p> <p>The book of <strong>the Allseer</strong> set out the earliest plans and justifications for the building of the Panopticon, and is our main source for its internal structure. It sets out the idea for the temple as a ring-shaped garden with a tower in the middle from which all of the garden can be observed. The garden was supposed to have three levels, stacked atop each other<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-3" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >3</a></sup>, all visible from the central tower.</p> <p>This garden would host religious rites and festivals. The book does not speak of any festivals in particular.</p> <p>Due to her death, worship of the Allseer was not present in any further writing.</p> <h2><span>Relationships with Others</span></h2> <h3><span>Humans</span></h3> <p>During the time of human subjugation to the gods of the Pantheon, the relationships between humans and gods were few and far between. That being said, <strong>the Allseer</strong> does seem to have cared deeply for humans, and been more on the side of self-determination and freedom for the human population.</p> <h3><span>Gods</span></h3> <h5><span>Nunca</span></h5> <p>One story recounts the relationship between Nunca and <strong>the Allseer</strong>. She refers to Nunca more formally than other characters, showing a unique respect for him. This respect was reciprocal, Nunca having shared a close friendship with her.</p> <p>Their friendship ended following a revelation of her vision of the future, specifically that Nunca would soon die.</p> <div class="blockquote"> <p><em>The Allseer knew on that day that she could no longer keep this a secret. Flowers on her head wilted, eyes unobscured and uncovered<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-4" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >4</a></sup>, she approached him.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;My brother Nunca,&quot; asked she, &quot;May we speak privately?&quot;</em><br /> <em>&quot;Yes!&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;Talk to me.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>The two ventured to the top of the highest peak in the village, where few ventured. Paths would never be beaten there before the village's end.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;My visions these past days have troubled me, as you know. One such vision concerns you, brother Nunca.&quot; she revealed to him.</em><br /> <em>&quot;Me?&quot;</em><br /> <em>&quot;Soon, you will see the day of your own destruction. Light of the sky and of laughter will be too much for your eyes. We can do nothing.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>Silence rang out. The peak's rickety willow calmed its rustling.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;&#8230;Thank you for telling me, I suppose. Do you know when?&quot;</em><br /> <em>&quot;You have but a month, brother.&quot;</em></p> </div> <p>She was correct.</p> <h5><span>Philia</span></h5> <p>The only other notable relation of <strong>the Allseer's</strong>, Philia knew her well. She was her primary confidant, not willing to burden Nunca with her worries.</p> <div class="blockquote"> <p><em>&quot;It's magnificent.&quot; she<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-5" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >5</a></sup> said, stepping back.</em></p> <p><em>Their statue had been as beautiful as they had imagined. The flower crown was then laid upon her head as a final touch — solidifying its reality for the two of them.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;Philia, sister of mine&#8230; may we take a break from our labours? To speak, I mean.&quot; asked the Allseer, less than concerned with the sculpture.</em><br /> <em>&quot;Oh? Do go on, you know I will always remain here for you, sister.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>The Allseer had always pitied Philia somewhat. She sensed betrayals in her future, yet saw her unequipped to handle them — a friend all too willing to bear the weight of a wolf leaning upon her for support, even as its claws dug into her. It appeared she would need to avail of this, though the very thought troubled her deeply. It mattered none at all.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;It is about&#8230;</em></p> <p><em>&#8230;the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist">humans</a>.&quot;</em></p> </div> <p>Though Philia had been warned of the upcoming massacre, she had been sworn to secrecy. It is unknown if she confronted the bastard Greyking or not, though this is unlikely.</p> <h5><span>Others</span></h5> <p>The ancient Pantheon often sought insight from <strong>the Allseer</strong>, asking her questions to varying degrees of success.</p> <p>The final story written about <strong>the Allseer</strong> was an exchange between <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-keymaster/offset/2">Gatekeeper</a> and her for this exact purpose.</p> <div class="blockquote"> <p><em>The last human squirmed through the door, and the two were finally alone. The master of Access spoke hoarsely and carefully.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;I ask for your insight once again, sister.&quot; he coughed out.</em><br /> <em>&quot;Go on, I have little time to entertain you.&quot; she responded, with barely the energy to spend on this conversation.</em><br /> <em>&quot;How do I assure the loyalty of my worshippers? I have been&#8230; I am suspicious of them, I will admit.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>This was not the sort of question she had been hoping for.</em></p> </div> <h1><span>Modern Day</span></h1> <p>It is unclear what happened to <strong>the Allseer</strong> following the original massacre. This is the period in which texts begin mentioning her more infrequently, and all artistic depictions originated prior to this point.</p> <p>She was killed by <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-iron-fist">the Iron Fist</a>. This has been boasted by them for many years. It is not known exactly how they managed to capture and murder her, given her foresight and knowledge<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-644961-6" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >6</a></sup>. According to them, she was one of the last to be killed of the original ancient Pantheon.</p> <p>An indirect reincarnation of <strong>the Allseer</strong> exists today, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-alchemist">the Alchemist</a>. This occured 200 years ago, and is most likely related to her creation of the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9">Faceless Ones</a>.</p> <div style="clear:both; height: 0px; font-size: 1px"></div> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-644961-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>.

Though this rule may be broken in times of scarcity according to the text's instructions.
