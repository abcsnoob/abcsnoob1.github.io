&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosie? Could you grab that pen over there?” &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/evangeline-holmes&quot;&gt;Evangeline&lt;/a&gt; asks her sister. She sighs and tosses her empty ballpoint pen into the bin. “This one is out again. God, who knew it’d be so damn hard to find a pen with full ink in this level? What was even the point of making this place an &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/evangeline-holmes&quot;&gt;Rosaline&lt;/a&gt; laughs at her mumblings and stands up from the bed, walking towards her sister’s makeshift vanity table. She pushes aside small stacks of papers, broken pens, and empty &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1&quot;&gt;Almond Water&lt;/a&gt; bottles until she finds a working pen. She haphazardly tosses it behind her and hits Evie square in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ay buisit ka- watch it, Rose- you just about blinded me!” Evangeline scolds her twin, which merely earns another laugh from her. She sighs and takes the projectile weapon. Resting against the wall of their bedroom, she clicks open the pen and begins to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rosaline sits back down beside her sister and clutches one of the pillows. She finds herself mesmerized by Evie’s writing, as she always had been since they were children. Her handwriting is eloquent and proper, as if writing a letter to the Queen. It’s something Rosie struggles with often- her handwriting normally falls back into a slightly messy cursive. As she’s just about to say something, someone knocks on the door. “Come in!” They yell out at the same time, both focusing more on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, Evie- &lt;em&gt;hey&lt;/em&gt;, baby.” Catelyn pops her head through the crack of the door. There is a tenderness in Catelyn’s green eyes when they fall onto one of the sisters. Rosaline is the first to look up, smiling lovingly at her girlfriend. “Just checking in on the two of you- the celebration’s just about to begin… your dad’s looking for you guys. You coming?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a sudden tension that settles into the room. When Catelyn recognizes it, her voice trails off and her smile fades a little. Rosie appears to be more bothered about the idea of going out, despite Evangeline being more occupied than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mm. Rosie can go ahead, I’ve just got a few more pages I need to spew out.” Evangeline hums and breaks the tension, teasingly waving Rosaline off. Her twins’ eyebrows furrow in protest, but her smirk contradicts the emotions her brows convey. Even with her eyes off the paper and onto Catelyn&#039;s, Rosie notices Evie continuing to write as though in perfect concentration, writing neatly and exactly on the line. Word after word after word. This is typical of Evie, she remembers–her thoughts were always just so eager to jump off her mind and onto the paper that she could achieve miraculous feats of multitasking just to keep writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing all too well how much it means to her, Catelyn nods, laughing a little. “If you say so… just don’t take another 3 hours, alright? You kinda need to socialize more than the bare minimum, you know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangeline gestures a thumbs up to her girlfriend. Cate laughs and waves them off, shutting the door behind her as she leaves. For a few moments, the room is silent. Rosaline looks around. Should she go now? Maybe wait? She’s not too sure. If anything, she’s unsure whether she wants to see their dad in the first place… He’s usually busy regardless, so surely he wouldn’t mind them being gone, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, Rosaline also doesn’t want to leave Evie behind. She remembers the last time she did. And when she did… Evangeline’s hand was gone. Rosaline wonders if her sister blames her for that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You waiting for a go signal or something, Rose?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Huh?” Rosaline snaps out of her thoughts, clearing her throat. “Oh… no, it’s okay. I want to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re gonna peer pressure me to come out earlier, I just know it!” Evie teases her twin sister, poking her in the cheek with the end part of her pen. Rosaline scoffs and pushes the pen away from her face, rolling her eyes in feigned annoyance. Her sister smirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to peer pressure you into leaving the room, honest!” Her reply is met with suspicion, with Evangeline raising her brow. Rosaline crosses her arms, “I’m serious!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both exchange laughter before silence befalls them again. Eventually, Evangline stops writing with her pen. She sighs in satisfaction and places her work down beside her, pulling out her hair tie and letting her hair fall and rest upon her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exposed the twins’ biggest differences. Evie never liked having her black hair in her face and everywhere else, so she kept it trimmed rather often, always just above her shoulders. Rosaline on the other hand had little preference length-wise, experimenting with her hair a lot. This time – as she hadn’t had time to get it cut in a while – she had hers right below her chest. The low buns they would both have during missions with the M.E.G., however, made it a little harder to tell them apart. Despite being adults, they couldn’t help but occasionally prank other M.E.G. members by acting like the other, like they were kids in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms&quot;&gt;Frontrooms&lt;/a&gt;. It was a fun way for them to stay connected with their childhood – back when they were safe, far away from the cruel and boundless Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never thought to ask you,” Rosaline speaks up first, turning her whole body to face her sister, “did you ever write about us – or you – being here? I mean, like in a story. Did you ever write about us… leaving this place?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangeline takes a moment to think about this, looking around her room and at the stacks of papers neatly arranged on the tables and chairs. “Mm… Not… not us, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not us?” Rose repeats, tilting her head. Evangeline nods simply. “What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evie bites her lip, as if to think about whether she should really answer this question. It worries Rosaline, but then Evie begins to reply: “I mean… think about it.” She pauses for a moment. “Do you… do you really think we’re getting out of here? I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosie’s almost baffled by the nature of this question. Of course, no one in the Backrooms has ever documented a door or a level that could get them to leave, and no one even knows just how far this realm can go&amp;#8230;. But who would &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; want to accept or acknowledge that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between being realistic or being hopeful, she decides to go with the latter route. “Of course we are, Evie- we’ve already gotten this far, right?” She tries to give her sister a hopeful smile, but it comes off awkward and nervous. “The M.E.G. has already achieved so many things, and we have been part of those things too… who knows, maybe- maybe by tomorrow, we’ll finally be out of here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangeline suddenly lets out a loud, short laugh. There’s a coldness in her laugh. “Yea, well… Unlike us, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; don’t have to wait.” She gestures towards her stories with her mouth, a painfully cliché Filipino way of pointing at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosaline looks around, trying to pinpoint which stack of papers her sister was referring to before realizing she meant all of them. Her eyes skim over a couple. It was just like Evie&#039;d said - they were set in the Backrooms, but the protagonists weren&#039;t really them. There’s a large variety of characters in her tales- humans and entities alike, but never&amp;#8230; them. Evie lets her twin read a couple before speaking again. “I never thought it practical or… kind to us to write us an escape story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosie double-takes at her sister after that. Evangeline wastes no time before continuing: “If I wrote the both of us into a story about us finally leaving this- this stupid maze, I think it would hurt me– hurt &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, I mean. Sure, it’s ‘hopeful’ or whatever… but after the story’s done, we have to look at reality again and sit in it. We’re just… we’re just so far from home…” Her voice breaks and trails off as she coughs to clear her throat. Her eyelids flutter and she looks away, toward the bedroom door. Rosaline notices the scrapped drafts in the bin next to her desk. “So.. when I write about somebody else, it’s not as close to home. I can forget for a while&amp;#8230; but I don’t get… lost in it.” Evangeline places her hands up in the air as if to be pressing against the wall, then drops her hands to her lap. A sad smile creeps up her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wish&amp;#8230; I wish we were them… for a day.&amp;quot; Rosaline sighs, glancing at Evie&#039;s latest story. Evie cocks her head at this statement. &amp;quot;Your characters, I mean. We&#039;d hide behind their faces like masks, and we&#039;d go on all sorts of adventures without worrying about all this&amp;#8230; danger. We&#039;d be able to go back home at the end of the day- we would be at peace- we&#039;d&amp;#8230; we&#039;d be okay&amp;#8230;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her sister snickers. Evangeline looks down at a random corner of the room. “Yeah… I wish for that too. Imagine it, huh? I guess that’s what they say about authors… there’s always a piece of them behind whoever they write. Guess that applies to me too, huh?” Rosaline nods in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mhm… Hah. You know&amp;#8230; in a way, you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; kind of write us in these pages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hm?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosie pats the pages beside them. “There’s always two people in here. Doesn’t matter who they are, but they’re always friends or siblings. That’s us in reality, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her twin widens her eyes, surprised by this analysis, as if the idea hadn’t even really come to mind before. But the more she thinks about it, the more she realizes that Rosaline is right… it is them. On every page. Evie smiles and chuckles, the coldness fading away. “I suppose so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosaline lays her head on Evie’s shoulder tenderly, wrapping her arms around hers. There’s a lot of things the twins could say to each other at this moment. Words of encouragement that one day they really will leave… gratitude toward one another… maybe even shed a couple tears. But they don’t. The sounds of celebration from outside slip through the closed bedroom, being the only ambience other than the quiet, flickering noises of the lantern that sits on Evie’s bedside table. There’s many things they could say… but right now, the silence is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few moments, the sisters sit up properly, restacking a couple papers and placing them aside. Without a word the two of them stand up, walking toward the door and promptly leaving the bedroom to join the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This is typical of Evie, she remembers–her thoughts were always just so eager to jump off her mind and onto the paper that she could achieve miraculous feats of multitasking just to keep writing.</p> <p>Knowing all too well how much it means to her, Catelyn nods, laughing a little. “If you say so… just don’t take another 3 hours, alright? You kinda need to socialize more than the bare minimum, you know!”</p> <p>Evangeline gestures a thumbs up to her girlfriend. Cate laughs and waves them off, shutting the door behind her as she leaves. For a few moments, the room is silent. Rosaline looks around. Should she go now? Maybe wait? She’s not too sure. If anything, she’s unsure whether she wants to see their dad in the first place… He’s usually busy regardless, so surely he wouldn’t mind them being gone, right?</p> <p>Besides, Rosaline also doesn’t want to leave Evie behind. She remembers the last time she did. And when she did… Evangeline’s hand was gone. Rosaline wonders if her sister blames her for that…</p> <p>“You waiting for a go signal or something, Rose?”</p> <p>“Huh?” Rosaline snaps out of her thoughts, clearing her throat. “Oh… no, it’s okay. I want to stay.”</p> <p>“You’re gonna peer pressure me to come out earlier, I just know it!” Evie teases her twin sister, poking her in the cheek with the end part of her pen. Rosaline scoffs and pushes the pen away from her face, rolling her eyes in feigned annoyance. Her sister smirks.</p> <p>“I’m not going to peer pressure you into leaving the room, honest!” Her reply is met with suspicion, with Evangeline raising her brow. Rosaline crosses her arms, “I’m serious!”</p> <p>They both exchange laughter before silence befalls them again. Eventually, Evangline stops writing with her pen. She sighs in satisfaction and places her work down beside her, pulling out her hair tie and letting her hair fall and rest upon her shoulders.</p> <p>This exposed the twins’ biggest differences. Evie never liked having her black hair in her face and everywhere else, so she kept it trimmed rather often, always just above her shoulders. Rosaline on the other hand had little preference length-wise, experimenting with her hair a lot. This time – as she hadn’t had time to get it cut in a while – she had hers right below her chest. The low buns they would both have during missions with the M.E.G., however, made it a little harder to tell them apart. Despite being adults, they couldn’t help but occasionally prank other M.E.G. members by acting like the other, like they were kids in the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms">Frontrooms</a>. It was a fun way for them to stay connected with their childhood – back when they were safe, far away from the cruel and boundless Backrooms.</p> <p>“I never thought to ask you,” Rosaline speaks up first, turning her whole body to face her sister, “did you ever write about us – or you – being here? I mean, like in a story. Did you ever write about us… leaving this place?”</p> <p>Evangeline takes a moment to think about this, looking around her room and at the stacks of papers neatly arranged on the tables and chairs. “Mm… Not… not us, I suppose.”</p> <p>“Not us?” Rose repeats, tilting her head. Evangeline nods simply. “What do you mean?”</p> <p>Evie bites her lip, as if to think about whether she should really answer this question. It worries Rosaline, but then Evie begins to reply: “I mean… think about it.” She pauses for a moment. “Do you… do you really think we’re getting out of here? I mean, <em>really</em>?”</p> <p>Rosie’s almost baffled by the nature of this question. Of course, no one in the Backrooms has ever documented a door or a level that could get them to leave, and no one even knows just how far this realm can go&#8230;. But who would <em>genuinely</em> want to accept or acknowledge that?</p> <p>Between being realistic or being hopeful, she decides to go with the latter route. “Of course we are, Evie- we’ve already gotten this far, right?” She tries to give her sister a hopeful smile, but it comes off awkward and nervous. “The M.E.G. has already achieved so many things, and we have been part of those things too… who knows, maybe- maybe by tomorrow, we’ll finally be out of here!”</p> <p>Evangeline suddenly lets out a loud, short laugh. There’s a coldness in her laugh. “Yea, well… Unlike us, <em>they</em> don’t have to wait.” She gestures towards her stories with her mouth, a painfully cliché Filipino way of pointing at things.</p> <p>Rosaline looks around, trying to pinpoint which stack of papers her sister was referring to before realizing she meant all of them. Her eyes skim over a couple. It was just like Evie'd said - they were set in the Backrooms, but the protagonists weren't really them. There’s a large variety of characters in her tales- humans and entities alike, but never&#8230; them. Evie lets her twin read a couple before speaking again. “I never thought it practical or… kind to us to write us an escape story.”</p> <p>Rosie double-takes at her sister after that. Evangeline wastes no time before continuing: “If I wrote the both of us into a story about us finally leaving this- this stupid maze, I think it would hurt me– hurt <em>us</em>, I mean. Sure, it’s ‘hopeful’ or whatever… but after the story’s done, we have to look at reality again and sit in it. We’re just… we’re just so far from home…” Her voice breaks and trails off as she coughs to clear her throat. Her eyelids flutter and she looks away, toward the bedroom door. Rosaline notices the scrapped drafts in the bin next to her desk. “So.. when I write about somebody else, it’s not as close to home. I can forget for a while&#8230; but I don’t get… lost in it.” Evangeline places her hands up in the air as if to be pressing against the wall, then drops her hands to her lap. A sad smile creeps up her face.</p> <p>&quot;I wish&#8230; I wish we were them… for a day.&quot; Rosaline sighs, glancing at Evie's latest story. Evie cocks her head at this statement. &quot;Your characters, I mean. We'd hide behind their faces like masks, and we'd go on all sorts of adventures without worrying about all this&#8230; danger. We'd be able to go back home at the end of the day- we would be at peace- we'd&#8230; we'd be okay&#8230;.&quot;</p> <p>Her sister snickers. Evangeline looks down at a random corner of the room. “Yeah… I wish for that too. Imagine it, huh? I guess that’s what they say about authors… there’s always a piece of them behind whoever they write. Guess that applies to me too, huh?” Rosaline nods in response.</p> <p>“Mhm… Hah. You know&#8230; in a way, you <em>did</em> kind of write us in these pages.”</p> <p>“Hm?”</p> <p>Rosie pats the pages beside them. “There’s always two people in here. Doesn’t matter who they are, but they’re always friends or siblings. That’s us in reality, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Her twin widens her eyes, surprised by this analysis, as if the idea hadn’t even really come to mind before. But the more she thinks about it, the more she realizes that Rosaline is right… it is them. On every page. Evie smiles and chuckles, the coldness fading away. “I suppose so.”</p> <p>Rosaline lays her head on Evie’s shoulder tenderly, wrapping her arms around hers. There’s a lot of things the twins could say to each other at this moment. Words of encouragement that one day they really will leave… gratitude toward one another… maybe even shed a couple tears. But they don’t. The sounds of celebration from outside slip through the closed bedroom, being the only ambience other than the quiet, flickering noises of the lantern that sits on Evie’s bedside table. There’s many things they could say… but right now, the silence is good enough.</p> <p>After a few moments, the sisters sit up properly, restacking a couple papers and placing them aside. Without a word the two of them stand up, walking toward the door and promptly leaving the bedroom to join the party.</p> </div> <hr /> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; The Peace Beneath A Pen: A &quot;Through Our Eyes&quot; Short Tale | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/to-return-home">Through Our Eyes, Part 1: To Return Home</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="TrailmixNCocoa" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" >TrailmixNCocoa</a></span></p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <p><em>The fire seemed to spread everywhere.</em></p> <p><em>You run through the halls, feeling the flames tickle your skin and clothes, trying to find a way out. Below you was a grand staircase, leading to the front entrance. <strong>Shit,</strong> you think, struggling to breathe, the smoke clinging onto your lungs and making you cough. <strong>The doors are blocked.</strong> You take sight of the windows beside it, seeing the glass was cracked, easy enough for you to break and jump out of. You stumble down the steps; you're so close.</em></p> <p><em>You frantically look around for something to hit the glass with. Picking up a brick, you chuck it towards the window, effectively crashing through it. You're just about to jump out when, instinctively, you look up—a beam from above creaking and collapsing—you fall back before it crushes you, yelping. You curse out loud, now not knowing where to go. Turn around, you find that the flames had stopped moving and crackling. They were still there, in its horridly majestic, orange glow, yet it was almost as if they went through a pause in time. For a moment, it even seemed as if the smoke settled to the floor, surrounding you like a low, black fog.</em></p> <p><em>Before you was a grand throne of gold. It had intricate, elaborate designs, with the swirls adorning the top of its frame like a tiara. Upon the seat was a mask with the color of burgundy—it had golden feathers at the nose bridge, as bright as the throne. There was an incredible urge to put it on; you could hear whispers emanating from it, almost pleading for you to put it on your face.</em></p> <p><em>All thoughts seem to leave your head, leaving it blank with only the desire to take the mask. Slowly, as the fire seemed to crackle again, you picked it up, slowly putting it on your face and tightening the lace around your head.</em></p> <p><em>You felt a tad lightheaded at first—not too much for you to faint—but enough for you to turn back around. You gasp at the sight of what seemed to be an army of sorts before you, all wearing masks of different kinds. They all seem so familiar to you: someone with a black jacket, and shoulder-length blonde hair, another with braids, and another with long, auburn hair. You wanted to run, but you stayed frozen in place, gripping a knife you didn't realize you had until it squeezed itself against your skin a tad too hard.</em></p> <p><em>There was someone in the back of a group—someone maskless—running through the crowd; the redness of the place had grown so strong, however, you couldn't see who they were. You try to move, only for you to grow terribly weak; your ability to breathe diminishing. Before you could collapse, they run up to you with a dagger, plunging it into your chest. Your vision could collect nothing but piercing green eyes.</em></p> <p><em>And before you knew it, your world fell into darkness.</em></p> <hr /> <p>You yelp, jolting yourself awake and breathing heavily. You groan at the same dream you've had for the past few months. You run a hand through your short, black hair, looking at the time, and cursing quietly at the sight of 12&#160;pm. <em>Late again, what could be new,</em> you think, deciding it was about time you got up. Standing up, you gaze out the window, admiring the view of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>. After 5 years, it seems, the place never ceased to amaze you—buildings floating here and there, a few vendors out and about selling snacks, and a multitude of wanderers and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9">Facelings</a>, all conversing with each other. In the infinite expanse of seemingly hopeless ventures, there is at least some amount of normalcy that makes it worth living in a place like the Backrooms. Somehow, through sheer determination in spite of their desires to go back to the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms">Frontrooms</a>, humans still found a way to make this place a temporary home.</p> <p>At the front door, the doorbell rings. Realizing who it could be, you excitedly run through the apartment and to the door, pulling it open and revealing your fiancée, Catelyn Rodriguez.</p> <p>&quot;My darling!&quot; You exclaim, wrapping your arms around her ever-beautiful body. She meets you with the same glee, giving you a warm kiss on the lips.</p> <p>&quot;It feels like it's been forever, love,&quot; Catelyn says, her voice nearly breaking in pure wistfulness. &quot;How was your mission? Was it too difficult? Did you get hurt anywhere?&quot; Cate worriedly pushes you inside the apartment, closing the door and bringing you to the dining area. She looks at your arms, face, etc, looking for any injuries.</p> <p>You laugh, taking her hands and pecking them softly, saying, &quot;Nothing to get me in critical condition, darling, that is as much as I know.&quot; She smiles, her concern fading away. &quot;Now. Is it really just you here? Where is my father? My sister?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They couldn't come, they're far too busy with Project UnMasked,&quot; Cate responds, rubbing the back of her neck. &quot;They send their regards, however. They terribly miss you and have even postponed the beginning of the experiment until today, when you come home.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Project UnMasked?&quot; you repeat, leaning in curiosity. &quot;Isn't that the project for <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a>?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Why, yes. I'm sure I've told you all about it in my letters. It's going to be a very revolutionary thing, this experiment. It's going to help everyone.&quot;</p> <p>You smile in agreement, remembering the letters. Project UnMasked, as far as you knew, was an experiment based on tolerance that aimed to reduce the effects of Wall Masks as much as possible, so that anyone who was unlucky enough to wear it wouldn't fall victim to its murderous urges. It would hopefully make it far easier to remove the mask by will, as well as find features within them to exploit and, in time, take them away for good.</p> <p>You grin, moving away from the dining table and holding her hips, a suggestive expression on your face. &quot;You know what else is a revolution?&quot; you say slyly, looking into her gorgeous green eyes, the way the strands of red hair adorably dressed her pale, delicate face. &quot;The time we'll be changing your last name to mine in a month or so.&quot;</p> <p>She giggles, wrapping her arms around your neck. &quot;Aw, too excited for me to be your wife, Ms. Holmes?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You know me too well, love.&quot;</p> <p>The two of you laugh, sharing another kiss before deciding that you ought to get ready. You head into the bathroom, shower, and dress, excitement flowing through your veins. You pull your hair up, letting your side bangs dangle. Pulling up a brown cardigan that accented well with your hazel-gold eyes, you walk out of your room, finding your beloved making a small snack for the two of you. You lean on the door frame in utter infatuation, watching her small, smooth hands working with the even smaller knife, cutting up a few apple slices.</p> <p>&quot;How sweet of you, Cate,&quot; you coo as she sits you down, placing down two plates of scrambled eggs and sliced apples.</p> <p>She laughs, popping a slice into her mouth. &quot;Well, I'm not about to let you go anywhere without something to fill your stomach, love.&quot;</p> <p>In the next few minutes, the two of you catch up. You had almost forgotten that you had been gone for nearly two months—moving across multiple levels for multiple objectives. Meanwhile, your sister, father, and Cate (along with the rest of the Veracity Searchers team) worked hard in collecting a variety of Wall Masks, as well as choosing volunteers to be a part of the Project UnMasked. One of the researchers, Tristan Petrovic, had suggested keeping the volunteer search within the M.E.G. and their families, in case any spies from opposing GOIs tries to sabotage the experiment (nothing less than what you expected from your best friend; he was always the type to think about the M.E.G.'s reputation). The experiment would only last for a span of 2 months, and everyone would get rations of that time's length by the end of it.</p> <p>&quot;I suppose everyone must be excited then,&quot; you eventually say, finishing up your last bite. &quot;It's been a while since we took a risky experiment like this. At least everyone's okay with it, yeah?&quot;</p> <p>Catelyn nods as you get up and take the empty dishes, walking into the kitchen to wash them. &quot;Yep! All who have volunteered understood the risks, and they're all rather eager to get started. Even your sister was excited to be a part of-&quot;</p> <p>You both widen your eyes at what she said. &quot;What? She's being a part of the experiment?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she replies slowly. &quot;She insisted—well—she insisted on being a part of it.&quot;</p> <p>You couldn't help but frown. &quot;But it's a tolerance experiment, isn't it? Wouldn't that be too taxing on her? Not just physically, but mentally. Not to mention that it could be dangerous.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I know, and I've mentioned that&#8230;&quot; Catelyn fidgets with a small section of her hair. &quot;Your father approved, however, so there wasn't much of a way to say no.&quot;</p> <p>You huff, looking away for a moment and placing the final fork into the dish rack, drying your hands. &quot;Suppose there's not if he says so.&quot; You lean on the table, a worried expression on your face. &quot;Still, though. I can't help but be concerned.&quot;</p> <p>Your beloved places a warm hand upon yours reassuringly. &quot;Come now. We both know her. Strong girl, no matter the circumstance.&quot; You nod, sighing quietly. You supposed there was only one way to really find out if she was ready or not.</p> <p>After cleaning up, the two of you decided that it was high time to leave the apartment. You grab your things, holding Cate's hand tightly, and leave the complex.</p> <p>With the number of people that seemed to fill the section of Level 11, you sometimes forget that the place was actually infinite—indulging in the sound of delighted chatter; sellers calling out for customers from inside of their stores and cars zooming past you. Occasionally, you could hear the twitter of a bird or two. It was far more refreshing than the levels you had been to recently. If you couldn't go anywhere else, you thought, you'd be happy to never leave.</p> <p>After a stop at Malt Mart, you headed into a seemingly abandoned office building. You opened the door for Catelyn and enter yourself into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a>. The ever-busy sounds of Level 11 slowly faded away as you walked further into the office building, subjecting you to its uncomfortable silence. The flickering lights seemed to be the only jagged and broken music filling the place, besides the harmonies of the various broken fountains spilling water. The carpet felt misplaced at times, causing the two of you to trip every now and then. After numerous twists and turns through the different rooms of Level 4, you were happy to once more hear and see guards talking. A sign hung up on the walls of the room, with &quot;M.E.G. - Base Omega&quot; written on it. You sigh of relief, squeezing Cate's hand as you walked up to the guards, showing your I.D.s and walking into the room.</p> <p>You greeted everyone as you walked by, heading into one of the offices within the base—the plaque on the ivory door reading &quot;Lorenzo H.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Hey!&quot; you call out excitedly as you open the door, seeing your sister leaning on the desk that stood in the center of the room. She squeals, running over and pulling you into a tight embrace, tears dotting her eyes.</p> <p>&quot;How have you been? How was the trip?&quot; She spouts out different questions all at once, stuttering here and there. &quot;You've been gone so long, and you- and you stopped responding to our letters two weeks ago, we were so worried—&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know&#8230;&quot; You say finally, wiping her eyes, feeling your own start to water. You notice Catelyn wiping hers, too. &quot;I am sorry I stopped, truly. Things happened, and I just had no opportunity to write back. But you knew that I'd come back, didn't you?&quot;</p> <p>Your sister nods, smiling. &quot;Of course. You always come back.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well, well, well!&quot; A man's voice called out. You knew all too well who it could be. &quot;If it isn't the grand reunion of the Holmes twins!&quot;</p> <p>Laughter sparks up between the four of you as you got up to embrace Tristan. He was the first one to find you, your pa, and sister 8 years ago when you had been left defending yourselves in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2">Level 2</a>. He was the one to introduce the 3 of you to the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">M.E.G.</a>, you remember. Since then, he had practically become your older brother.</p> <p>&quot;How have you been, stinker?&quot; He asks, ruffling your dark hair.</p> <p>&quot;Ah, if there's anything I wouldn't miss, it's those dumb nicknames of yours, Trist,&quot; you reply, finally letting go as you tried messing with his hair—though you could hardly reach the few strawberry blonde strands that dangled in front of his eyes. <em>Too damn tall, even now,</em> you thought. &quot;It's like it's been forever since I've seen you guys. I'm glad I'm home.&quot;</p> <p>Catelyn holds your hand with a sweet grin on her face. &quot;We're all glad, too.&quot;</p> <p>In the midst of the excitement, something else sparks in your mind. &quot;Oh, right. Where's pa?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Old man's over in one of the really big offices ways down on the left, setting the experiment up—wait, you know what experiment I'm talking about, yeah? I can call him over here if you'd like.&quot;</p> <p>You nod, a hint of sadness in your tone. &quot;Right. I see. I can tell how important this is for him, so you don't have to.&quot;</p> <p>Your sister tugs on your sleeve. &quot;Come now, I'm sure he'll come around, he's just a little busy is all.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Sure, like he always does, yeah?&quot; Your eyebrows furrowed, fists clenched. &quot;You know, it's fine. The last time he bothered being together with us, we ended up no-clipping to this hell of a place.&quot;</p> <p>Silence filled the room for a brief moment. As much as you tried to understand—and you really tried your hardest—you couldn't help but feel bitter. All of this time, after everything you guys had been through, you thought he would take working slow for once. But until now, hardly anything seemed to change.</p> <p>&quot;Well,&quot; Tristan spoke up, clearing his throat and shoving his hands into his pockets. &quot;We should head there ourselves, then. We ought to get the experimentees ready, anyway.&quot;</p> <p>You looked over to your sister. &quot;That reminds me. You're being a part of the experiment?&quot;</p> <p>She nods, almost awaiting the question. Your bitterness changed into concern. Before you could open your mouth to ask why, she looks to Tristan and Catelyn and asks, &quot;Could we have a minute?&quot;</p> <p>Cate nods quickly, gesturing Tristan towards the door as they swiftly make their way out, shutting the door behind them. Once they leave, you turn back to look at your sister, who was fidgeting her fingers. &quot;Well then,&quot; You say finally, crossing your legs and arms.</p> <p>&quot;You and Dad have been, well&#8230;&quot; she starts off, sitting beside you. &quot;Ever since we no-clipped and I got injured, you've all done nothing but make sure that I'm alright and never had any tough work. I apprec- I appreciate everything, you know, I do. But it feels like it's my turn now, too, isn't it?&quot;</p> <p>You lean back, sighing. &quot;But why be part of the experiment? And I mean, directly involved in it, as an experimentee. You could've been an archivist, you know? It'd be safer.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Sure, it would. But&#8230;&quot; Her voice trails off as she thinks of what to say. &quot;Think about it. Yeah, all the archivists, scientists, and everyone else, they're all- they're all a part of it. But the experiment groups, they help them find the results of their hypothesis, their analysis—you know— all that jazz.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's still dangerous, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/evangeline-holmes">Eve</a>.&quot;</p> <p>She gulps quietly, gripping your arm as she leans her head on your shoulder. &quot;I know it is, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/evangeline-holmes">Rosie</a>. But it'll be better. With you and Dad with me, it'll be like&#8230; I don't know. It'll be like we're just doing a little group activity at home.&quot;</p> <p>The two of you laugh as thoughts of your childhood reach the forefront of your minds. You couldn't feel too upset about it much further. It was still dangerous, the two of you knew that much. But she was your twin sister. She was far too like you, too stubborn, for you to try and deny her wishes. You sigh, getting up, deciding that the two of you should get going. You open the door revealing Tristan and Cate, who met you two again with warm smiles.</p> <p>This was indeed home, you thought. A hellish kind of home, perhaps, for its unforgiving conditions, and no exits. But with everyone else, perhaps, it was a place you were willing to go back to.</p> <p>To help everyone.</p> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">No&nbsp;place&nbsp;like&nbsp;home...</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">At&nbsp;least,&nbsp;not&nbsp;until&nbsp;it&nbsp;starts&nbsp;burning&nbsp;down.</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Yours truly,<br /> <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="TrailmixNCocoa" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" >TrailmixNCocoa</a></span><br /> <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trailmix-author-page">Author Page Here (Chocolate Inside)!</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="TrailmixNCocoa" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" >TrailmixNCocoa</a></span></p>

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;logoblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CW/TW: Mentions of blood, suicide, hallucinating(?). Read with discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You fidget with the satin pillow, jolts of excitement coursing through you as your fingers shake every once in a while. You stand up and look around your chamber, making sure nothing was out of place before you left. You shake the rest of your excitement away when someone knocks on your door—a young Maiden, Naomi Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Madam, here are the treats you wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; she speaks softly as she adjusts her violet &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Bauta mask&lt;/a&gt;, bringing in a cart full of small pastries. With the untouched ingredients found in the back of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Station 2&lt;/a&gt;, a few bakers within the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens&quot;&gt;Masked Maidens&lt;/a&gt; were able to create food that was safe enough to eat for as long as needed. You feel very proud as the thought passes through your mind, a small smile forming in satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh dear, you could have told me they were ready&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; You reply as quickly and politely as you can, slightly flustered. You were never quite used to the treatment you got from them. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You needn&#039;t bring them to me yourself&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s alright, I wanted to bring them to you. Though, pardon me, but are you sure this was the amount you wanted? There&#039;s quite a lot&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gulp quietly, your eyes quickly darting to the woven basket you had on the other side of the bed, nodding. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Yes, it&#039;s the perfect amount. You may leave them here. I&#039;ll bring it out when I&#039;m done&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Alright, Madam&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; Naomi smiles, curtsying. As she opens the door to leave, she says, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;May your truth be unmasked&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You nod. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;May your truth be unmasked&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she closes the door, you swipe the dust off your red dress, quickly take the basket out, and place some of the wrapped pastries inside. You&#039;re just about to turn to leave when suddenly-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sup! Been a while, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gasp as the voice from above startles you. Looking up, you see a few blond hairs, then a black jacket&amp;#8230; someone was hanging down from the ceiling. Before you can reply, the boy lands in front of you, a smile spread across his face as he dusts off any dirt that got on his jacket and jeans. It didn&#039;t take long to recognize him— you were certain of it since you heard the voice. Tom Von Haderach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Surprised? You look the part- can&#039;t blame you though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your eyes widen, and your voice comes out in hushed, panicked tones. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Tom?! What the fuck are you doing here? I thought we were supposed to meet, well&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-906&quot;&gt;you know where&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mind your language,&amp;quot; he says playfully, mocking &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-140&quot;&gt;Lady Blanche&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; tone. &amp;quot;I thought it&#039;d be a bit more fun to catch you off guard, and I was right! Besides, no way in hell you eat all those pastries by yourself,&amp;quot; he smiles, pointing to the cart by the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You let out a gasp. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You insult me, Tom. Are you trying to say that I&#039;m fat?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; You grin, laughing. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Well, since you&#039;re so hungry, have some. I was going to bring you a few anyway.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#039;t put words in my mouth, Evie,&amp;quot; Tom says with furrowed eyebrows and a hint of harshness for a second, immediately dropping it as he reached for the pastries. &amp;quot;Gotta say,&amp;quot; he said, in between bites, &amp;quot;You Maidens got great taste in pastries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You catch his tone and clear your throat. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Helps to have a station that&#039;s quite literally all about this stuff. You&#039;d think we&#039;d have multiple theatres as stations like this one, but no—a bakery is where it&#039;s at.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You sit on your bed, nibbling a strudel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&#039;d call you lucky, but I&#039;d be a bit of a hypocrite, since, you know.&amp;quot; Tom stares down at the pendant on his chest. &amp;quot;Lived most of my life under Blanche&#039;s wing.&amp;quot; He takes a seat on the bed by your side, pulling out a small box from his pocket. &amp;quot;Enough talk,&amp;quot; he says with a grin. &amp;quot;We have a score to settle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Pff, we both know how this ends,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; you reply, slightly loosening your mask. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;The Lady may have taught you a myriad of things, but beating me at Blackjack? Ha, good luck.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I know that.&amp;quot; You notice his grin growing, little by little. &amp;quot;Which is why I brought something a little different this time. When&#039;s the last time you played UNO? I swung by &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-389&quot;&gt;389&lt;/a&gt; on the way here- &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-99&quot;&gt;Penelope&lt;/a&gt; lent me this.&amp;quot; Tom shuffles the cards as he speaks. His hands work with the cards with great comfort and speed, each card slipping in between the other with ease. &amp;quot;Don&#039;t worry, I checked beforehand if the self-proclaimed Game Master didn&#039;t pull any of her tricks with this deck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You chuckle, a spark of anticipation igniting in your chest. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;As long as it doesn&#039;t end like the last time, with Candyland.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking and playing with Tom had felt like a release from the constant sense of duty. The funniest part about it was the fact that you could hardly remember when it first started. You watch fondly as he works with the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, wait, hold up.&amp;quot; Tom stops dealing cards, looking around the room. &amp;quot;Is it even safe to play cards here? You can&#039;t see it because of the mask, so you guys must&#039;ve forgotten about it, but the whole place&#039;s still burning up. The heat feels so real, I almost forgot that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294&quot;&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; isn&#039;t actually affected by it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Considering it hasn&#039;t gone up in flames yet, I can hope so.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; you respond with a slight sense of guilt, lightly tapping his forehead. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Now that you&#039;re mentioning it, put your mask on, silly. You&#039;re lucky you&#039;re not a crispy nom-Tom right now! The fire may not affect the level, but it would most certainly affect you.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ugh, fine,&amp;quot; he says, twirling the mask around his finger a few times before placing it on his face. You notice a faint hint of sadness on the tone, one that quickly vanished once he finishes dealing seven cards to you both. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You can go first.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card at the center was a yellow six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stare at Tom. He focuses on his cards. You wonder if he&#039;s hiding a good card behind that grin of his, or if he&#039;s hiding something else&amp;#8230; You play your card, a yellow eight, smiling a little bit. It&#039;s been ages since you last had a moment like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He plays a green eight, then you, a green two. Tension seems to grow between you as you start noticing a lack of black cards in his hand—you feel a strange sense of excitement and anticipation. Within a moment, after a few plays, you realize he has no blues. With 2 cards left, you feel like you&#039;re just about to win, until—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s see how you handle this one, Eve&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he says with a smirk, placing down a wild card that had a blank center. You think back to the last time you played Uno, which was just before you no-clipped during the car ride home—5, almost 6 years ago. No matter how much you thought about it, you couldn&#039;t remember a card like this being in the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What&#039;s this one meant to be for?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You ask, voice laced with suspicion as you squint your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom rearranges his hand, then sets them face down on the velvet mattress. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s a white wild card. When someone places it down, you&#039;re allowed to make your own house rule.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Huh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You say. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Alright then. What is it, then?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You answer a question of mine, any question. If not, draw half the deck.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Half the deck? Or a simple question?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Eh, wouldn&#039;t say simple.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; He taps the red comforters a few times. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;So, are you gonna answer?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You put your cards down this time, crossing your arms confidently. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Fine, I will. What&#039;s your question?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How are &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; doing? And I don&#039;t mean Madame Evangeline Holmes, I mean &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, the person beneath that fancy mask of yours.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smile that was on your face falls for a moment before you catch it and return to your cheerful demeanor. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How else would I be doing other than well? My people have made grand leaps in research, they&#039;re all still safe, and I&#039;m playing Uno with a wonderful friend of mine. Clearly, I&#039;m doing- I&#039;m doing fine-&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Your voice hitches and falters at the last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Really? I don&#039;t know, Evie, it&#039;s hard to believe you with that tone of yours.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh, fine.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You sigh softly, your smile slowly fading. You could ever so slightly feel the flames of the theatre&#039;s fire tickling your sleeves, a warmth you tried constantly to suppress. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I suppose I&#039;m&amp;#8230; well I&#039;m tired. I&#039;ve kept myself at the back of my people—but I&#039;ve been doing&amp;#8230; far more than I should endure. I just don&#039;t want my people to think I use them as a shield of some sort, you know?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing you had answered honestly, Tom&#039;s expression softens. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I see&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; He didn&#039;t seem to be paying much attention to the cards anymore, as evident by his cards falling to the carpet as he scoots closer to you. He pauses for a moment, considering his next words. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Ever notice how you keep straying back to &#039;your people?&#039; I get it, they&#039;re extremely important to you&amp;#8230; Though, I can&#039;t help but feel you&#039;re worrying too much. Being here so often probably isn&#039;t helping, either.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stare at the pile of cards at the top of the bed. Though they were stable and unmoving, multiple of them were off to the sides, their positions off kilter. &lt;em&gt;Maybe he&#039;s right,&lt;/em&gt; you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Mm. I have an idea.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Tom jumps out of bed, grabbing your wrist with a sly grin growing on his face. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Come on. I wanna take you somewhere.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You choose not to say much—not like you could refuse, anyway—as he takes you to the door. He peeks out, making sure no one was around, then slipping outside; across the hallways of the Dressing Rooms, and through the massive auditorium of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294&quot;&gt;Liminary Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, he weaves through the place, avoiding other Maidens who were talking and working in the seats as you both pass by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Where are you taking me?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You ask with a slightly impatient, worried tone, tugging at his sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Relax, I&#039;m not taking you anywhere dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; He looks back at you with a look of reassurance. You roll your eyes, turning back at the other Maidens, who were all busy with their tasks. You finally make it outside of the theatre and behind the building, where no one seemed to be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see him pull a small notebook from his pocket, noticing Blanche&#039;s signature on the first page. Much to your surprise, he skips over it, quickly flipping through the notebook until he finds a rather complex-looking sigil. Shortly after, an exact copy of the sigil hovers above Tom&#039;s hand like an aurora. Cautiously, he places it on the floor and grabs your wrist again. Before you could say a word, the light pulls the both of you in, the world around you turning to white, and then&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve arrived. Blanche calls the place the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-797&quot;&gt;Path Less Traveled&lt;/a&gt;. Ain&#039;t it gorgeous?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take a few seconds to recover, slowly opening your eyes and quietly observing your surroundings. You stand on a gravel path, surrounded by dense vegetation. Vines creep up the nearby trees; flowers glitter the soft grass and beams of sunlight breach through the clouds above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mutter a &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Gorgeous indeed,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; as you indulge in the sight. You turn to Tom, who also looks at you after taking his mask off, a look of satisfaction on his face. You can&#039;t help but smile for real. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#039;t thank me yet, Eve,&amp;quot; he says in return, sitting down on a rather large rock. &amp;quot;But, while we&#039;re at it, we&#039;re alone right now and not in a mask station. Why don&#039;t you take off your mask?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your expression falters. &lt;em&gt;He can&#039;t know. Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will happen if he finds out? That your world had already plunged into darkness?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiet, near unintelligible whispers dance in your mind. You feel your head burn, which forces you to close your eyes for a moment. Opening them again, you find this world, so previously filled with comfort and serenity, glowing a dark crimson hue. The shock quickly dissipates and replaces itself with a brewing fear when you realize what is happening. The bright, lively flowers that adorned the ground are now brittle and dead; the sun merely a faint, light red. Just barely, you could hear the crackle of flames. Tom smiled still, awaiting your answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Maybe next time.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t try. You sure you&#039;re ok, Evie?&amp;quot; Tom twirls his mask around his fingers before storing it away in a pocket. His voice is deep, echoing as if the two of you were locked in a large, empty chamber. &amp;quot;You look kinda spaced out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He has no eyes.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh, I&#039;m alright. Just taking in some inspiration, for the next time I draw.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Please, stop smiling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why don&#039;t we stay awhile, then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You rub your eyes, the view not going away soon enough. &lt;em&gt;Push through it. Push through it. Please push through it,&lt;/em&gt; you beg silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit next to one another, talking about everything your minds could think of—things you both had done before—but felt far, far different now. The laughter seems to fill the level, despite being outdoors. You wish it could last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment of silence after, as you both take a breath from laughing so much. At that moment, you get up and hug him tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Tom Von Haderach.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You stutter, trying to find the right words to say. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;For being a part of this Maiden&#039;s life.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woah, where&#039;d that come from?&amp;quot; His question is soaked in a playful, joking tone you&#039;d grown used to hearing from Tom. It, however, fails to the surprise you were sure he feels, &amp;quot;Jokes aside though,&amp;quot; he said, returning the hug, &amp;quot;I&#039;m glad to be of service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sigh and breathe deeply, shutting your eyes. As your eyelids flutter open, the deep ruby clouds vanish from the sky above, revealing a canvas painted in azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom gets up, hopping off the rock. &amp;quot;Man, I completely forgot I wanted to show you around the place!&amp;quot; He stretches his hand out toward you. You take it, accepting his help to climb down from the rock—it was exceptionally difficult in heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He checks his pocket watch and sighs slightly. &amp;quot;I don&#039;t have the time to show you everything&amp;#8230; what a bummer. Welp, guess I&#039;ll have to settle for the next best thing. Follow me! You&#039;re gonna love the view from up there,&amp;quot; he points toward a nearby mountain. &amp;quot;It&#039;s not a hard climb, there&#039;s a path that takes you straight to the top without much trouble.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grin, squeezing his hand just a little. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Alright, as long as I don&#039;t end up falling to my death.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Har har,&amp;quot; he responds, walking to the path of the mountain; past the rocks and vegetation; the forest, and up the mountain. Eventually, you grow tired of walking; you slip off your shoes to ease the discomfort, cringing at the feel of gravel. All that time within indoor stations has affected your comfortability, it seems. &amp;quot;You sure you don&#039;t want me to carry you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You can carry me when I&#039;m dead, Tom,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; you say with a groan, trying to keep pace. It wasn&#039;t long until you finally make your way up the mountain, the entrance to its peak covered by leaf-ridden branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do me a solid favor and close your eyes, will you?&amp;quot; Tom smiles, looking back at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You better not push me off the mountain&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; you say jokingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I won&#039;t, I won&#039;t, not yet at least.&amp;quot; The two of you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Fine, I&#039;ll do it.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Reluctantly, you close your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is gonna be worth the hassle, I promise.&amp;quot; You let Tom drive you through the rest of the path, listening to the shaking of leaves and the crunch of gravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, he breaks the silence. &amp;quot;Alright, you can open them! How&#039;s the view? You can see everything from up here! The dam, the forest outpost, and if you squint hard enough you can even see the bay in the distance!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take into view the waves of the bay lightly crashing into shore and the dam that took up quite a part of the level. The forest catches your eye the most—it was a striking hue of emerald, and you could just hear the chitter of whatever animals could be within. A small gasp leaves you, almost wondering why the place wasn&#039;t considered a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One day,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;we&#039;ll explore it all. Just you and me! We can draw maps, and camp, and tell stories around the campfire…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he continues to speak, his voice fades away. Your heart begins to feel as if anvils were weighing down on it. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to do that, Tom&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh? Why not?&amp;quot; he asks, with a hint of sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You quickly switch up your tone. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I don&#039;t mean I don&#039;t want to do that, I just mean—with everything I need to do with the Maidens—it may take longer than you&#039;re willing to wait.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His expression changes, turning into a soft smile. &amp;quot;So? You&#039;re one of my best friends. I&#039;m more than willing to wait.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Huh.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You feel yourself grow more cheery. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Right.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides,&amp;quot; he chuckles. &amp;quot;We both know you should take more breaks. I can teach you how to get here if you want someplace away from all the Maiden stuff. You need to promise me something, though. Do not bring anyone else with you. It could be dangerous to have multiple people here for all I know, and that&#039;s a risk I don&#039;t want to take.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You point at your mask, laughing a little as you say, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;With this mask? Ha. Hardly a break.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You tighten the lace around your ponytail. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;And of course, I promise. You have my word.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The both of you smile. &amp;quot;Good.&amp;quot; He sighed as he looks back at his pocket watch. &amp;quot;Well, I&#039;m afraid our time&#039;s almost up. It&#039;s almost tea time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Aw&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; You say with disappointment. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;To think we couldn&#039;t even finish our game.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pfft, don&#039;t you worry,&amp;quot; he responds, putting his hands on his hips. &amp;quot;That isn&#039;t over yet&amp;#8230; now that you mention that mask, though&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You watch the smile vanish from Tom&#039;s face like a wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I decided to see if I could find anything about them on the Cygnus Archive. I ended up reading a ton on the topic. There are a few things I don&#039;t understand, but those can wait, they&#039;re not why I&#039;m telling you this. How long has it been since you last took that mask off, Evie?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You frown, looking away. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hasn&#039;t been&amp;#8230; too long&amp;#8230;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Evie.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; He repeats with sternness, placing a firm hand on your shoulder. &amp;quot;How long?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You fall silent, fidgeting with your fingers. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Not since the second Resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom took a deep breath. &amp;quot;Feel like I&#039;m asking a stupid question here, but you are familiar with the Excess Effect, aren&#039;t you? Bloody hell&amp;#8230; the second Resistance? That was so long ago. How are you still holding up? I&#039;m worried, Evie. Worried that whatever&#039;s left of you gets lost behind that mask.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Pfff,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You try to laugh. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I have my ways.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#039;t look any less worried. &amp;quot;You may have your ways, but it&#039;s still concerning either way, Evie. I mean&amp;#8230; can you even take it off on your own will?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your tone grew sharper as you flip away your brown hair. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I haven&#039;t tried. And as far as I&#039;m certain, I don&#039;t need to try—I can&#039;t try. Not with everything going on.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom sighs, running a hand through his. &amp;quot;If you really insist on that, I won&#039;t push it. Just&amp;#8230; take care of yourself, okay? Please. Who knows what&#039;d happen if that double-edged sword of yours finally lands a fatal hit on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I— I will. Don&#039;t worry about it.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#8230;right. &amp;#8230;Why can&#039;t I believe you?&amp;quot; He sits down on a nearby rock, staring you dead in the eyes. &amp;quot;You&#039;re hiding something, I can tell that much. So, how&#039;s it gonna be? You feel like talking to someone sometime soon, or are you going to let it drag you down to the Grave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You scoff a small bit, trying to shrug it off. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t you have somewhere to be?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He crosses his arms in defense. &amp;quot;I&#039;m sure Blanche can wait since it&#039;s about you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Can&#039;t I just tell you some other time when, y&#039;know, neither of us are busy?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&#039;s not how this works, Evie.&amp;quot; A brow is raised, his tone almost impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Sure it does, it happens all the time-&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#039;re still dodging the question&amp;#8230; look, after we&#039;re done, you can ask me anything in return. Alright? But for now, this is about &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;quot; he says, tapping your forehead. &amp;quot;Worst case scenario, I&#039;ll just shut up and listen. I promise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sigh, rubbing your forehead and giving in. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Fine&amp;#8230; How do I even—why don&#039;t I just&amp;#8230; show you?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; He tilts his head slightly as you gesture to the mask in his pocket. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Put your mask on.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused, he puts the mask on. &amp;quot;Eugh, could never get used to this thing. So, what do we do now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stare into his eyes, then close yours, channeling your θέαμα Colombina. However, instead of seeing into his vision, you allow him to see into yours. In a moment, you loosen your self-control, allowing your emotions to swirl and overwhelm you. Anger&amp;#8230; despair&amp;#8230; desolation. You open your eyes, and the sky changes once again to a blood red, only deeper and vibrant in hue. You see Tom gasp, and you know he saw that he lacked eyes. Your head aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom, unable to endure it, tears his mask off, breathing deeply. &amp;quot;What,&amp;quot; he said in-between breaths, &amp;quot;What the fuck was that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I don&#039;t usually see it when I&#039;m around other Maidens, but&amp;#8230; I just couldn&#039;t hold it back this time.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You say, suddenly growing lightheaded. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s the E.E.Ls. They&#039;ve gone too high. By the time I&#039;ve realized&amp;#8230; it was too late. I can&#039;t take it off anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#8230;?&amp;quot; His face grows grim. &amp;quot;Why didn&#039;t— why didn&#039;t you tell me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I didn&#039;t want you to harm yourself finding a solution for me&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; you say, almost desperately. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I know you, Tom—you&#039;ll do whatever it takes—&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And? What about you, Evie? Just- damn it!&amp;quot; Tom sounds angry for a moment, standing up and punching a nearby rock. It leaves a dent in the rock, with small drops of blood staining it and the ground. &amp;quot;Why didn&#039;t I get around to this sooner? There&#039;s got to be something that can be done, and I swear I&#039;m gonna find it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;No, see, that&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; The volume of your voice rises as you try going up to him. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You can&#039;t. At least—at least not right now.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turns to look at you with a frustration in his eyes that almost scares you. His breaths become quick, his face flushed. &amp;quot;And then what? I&#039;m just supposed to let- to let this happen until I realize it&#039;s too late, that you&#039;ve lost your mind permanently? That you could kill yourself? Huh? Tell me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There comes a moment of silence. You hear the wind howling nearby, dragging a few leaves through the air. Tom breaks the quiet with a small sigh. You look down, unable to keep your tears from falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey,&amp;quot; he says finally, his voice softer now. He hugs you, rubbing your back. It only makes you cry harder. &amp;quot;I&#039;m sorry&amp;#8230; alright? I guess we both got a little overwhelmed, huh&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chuckle comes in between cries. You think you hear a sniffle. Quietly, you apologize, and many times until Tom stops you from doing so. You both sit back down, looking out at the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I think we&#039;ve been here a tad too long,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; you mention, fiddling with the straps of your heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah,&amp;quot; Tom replies, scoffing amusingly. &amp;quot;I&#039;m so screwed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Not like you cared earlier.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Har har,&amp;quot; he says sarcastically, rolling his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit up straight, looking at him. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You said I could ask you anything if I answered you, right?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighs in response. &amp;quot;Yeah. What&#039;s your question, then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You prepare yourself with a pause, almost wanting to withdraw from saying it. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;If I die&amp;#8230; could you help the Leading Maidens watch over the others for me?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like hell I&#039;m letting you die anytime soon, Evie.&amp;quot; Tom frowns, crossing his legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s not like I&#039;m planning to, just—please just answer,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; you plead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#8230;Alright. I will. That&#039;s a worry for some other time, though. I&#039;m going to tell Blanche about this. If there&#039;s anyone who can find a solution, it&#039;s probably her&amp;#8230;&amp;quot; You watch him scoot over to you before hugging you again. &amp;quot;For now, just&amp;#8230; take care, okay? Try to at least.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Right. I&#039;ll give it my all.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; You yawn, stretching as you pull away. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How long have we been here for?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eh,&amp;quot; he replies, looking at his pocket watch for the third time. &amp;quot;Not tooooo long. Just long enough for what would be a 2-hour lecture from Blanche.&amp;quot; The two of you laugh at the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gaze one last time at the landscape before turning back, ready to return home. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;We really should get going, no?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yup. C&#039;mon,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I&#039;ll take you home. I&#039;m late to tea anyway, and I feel like we could end this on a different note.&amp;quot; He scratched the back of his head. &amp;quot;Besides, I think I have a pretty good excuse for being this late,&amp;quot; he adds with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offers you his hand, which you take. He asks you to close your eyes again and he leads you back down the mountain, through the gravel path, and eventually back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294&quot;&gt;Level μ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for today&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; You say as you both enter your room, sitting down on the bed. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Even if things got a little&amp;#8230; well, you know&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Heated?&amp;quot; He laughs for a little. &amp;quot;Sorry, couldn&#039;t resist making the pun. No need to thank me, though. Glad to be of service,&amp;quot; he bows. &amp;quot;I&#039;ll be sure to drop by again sometime soon, and next time, maybe we could have an actual game of UNO without the gimmicks? I kinda lied about checking the deck for the Game Master&#039;s tricks&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I could tell&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; a light chuckle leaves you. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I&#039;ll be waiting for that next time, Tom. Probably won&#039;t be any time soon, judging by the lecture you&#039;ve got coming&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of you chuckle before saying goodbye. You watch him leave and your expression falters. Alone again. &lt;em&gt;Ah well,&lt;/em&gt; you think. Another day will come, surely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look back at the cart, which had been left untouched since you and Tom left the Level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ought to put it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Psst&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; You hear a familiar voice coming from behind you. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I forgot these masks could do this!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; It&#039;s Tom, again. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Just wanted to say that no, you&#039;re not alone in this. I&#039;m still here. Probably won&#039;t be having my mask on all the time, but if you need something, you know where to find me, okay&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You smile. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Okay, Tom&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; You feel the link between your minds disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take a bite out of one of the pastries in the cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe putting it back can wait.&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <div class="logoblock"> <p>CW/TW: Mentions of blood, suicide, hallucinating(?). Read with discretion.</p> </div> <p>You fidget with the satin pillow, jolts of excitement coursing through you as your fingers shake every once in a while. You stand up and look around your chamber, making sure nothing was out of place before you left. You shake the rest of your excitement away when someone knocks on your door—a young Maiden, Naomi Brighton.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Madam, here are the treats you wanted</em>,&quot; she speaks softly as she adjusts her violet <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Bauta mask</a>, bringing in a cart full of small pastries. With the untouched ingredients found in the back of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67">Station 2</a>, a few bakers within the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens">Masked Maidens</a> were able to create food that was safe enough to eat for as long as needed. You feel very proud as the thought passes through your mind, a small smile forming in satisfaction.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Oh dear, you could have told me they were ready</em>!&quot; You reply as quickly and politely as you can, slightly flustered. You were never quite used to the treatment you got from them. &quot;<em>You needn't bring them to me yourself</em>!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>It's alright, I wanted to bring them to you. Though, pardon me, but are you sure this was the amount you wanted? There's quite a lot&#8230;</em>.&quot;</p> <p>You gulp quietly, your eyes quickly darting to the woven basket you had on the other side of the bed, nodding. &quot;<em>Yes, it's the perfect amount. You may leave them here. I'll bring it out when I'm done</em>.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Alright, Madam</em>,&quot; Naomi smiles, curtsying. As she opens the door to leave, she says, &quot;<em>May your truth be unmasked</em>.&quot;</p> <p>You nod. &quot;<em>May your truth be unmasked</em>.&quot;</p> <p>As she closes the door, you swipe the dust off your red dress, quickly take the basket out, and place some of the wrapped pastries inside. You're just about to turn to leave when suddenly-</p> <p>&quot;Sup! Been a while, huh?&quot;</p> <p>You gasp as the voice from above startles you. Looking up, you see a few blond hairs, then a black jacket&#8230; someone was hanging down from the ceiling. Before you can reply, the boy lands in front of you, a smile spread across his face as he dusts off any dirt that got on his jacket and jeans. It didn't take long to recognize him— you were certain of it since you heard the voice. Tom Von Haderach.</p> <p>&quot;Surprised? You look the part- can't blame you though.&quot;</p> <p>Your eyes widen, and your voice comes out in hushed, panicked tones. &quot;<em>Tom?! What the fuck are you doing here? I thought we were supposed to meet, well&#8230; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-906">you know where</a></em>!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Mind your language,&quot; he says playfully, mocking <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-140">Lady Blanche's</a> tone. &quot;I thought it'd be a bit more fun to catch you off guard, and I was right! Besides, no way in hell you eat all those pastries by yourself,&quot; he smiles, pointing to the cart by the door.</p> <p>You let out a gasp. &quot;<em>You insult me, Tom. Are you trying to say that I'm fat?&quot;</em> You grin, laughing. <em>&quot;Well, since you're so hungry, have some. I was going to bring you a few anyway.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Don't put words in my mouth, Evie,&quot; Tom says with furrowed eyebrows and a hint of harshness for a second, immediately dropping it as he reached for the pastries. &quot;Gotta say,&quot; he said, in between bites, &quot;You Maidens got great taste in pastries.&quot;</p> <p>You catch his tone and clear your throat. &quot;<em>Helps to have a station that's quite literally all about this stuff. You'd think we'd have multiple theatres as stations like this one, but no—a bakery is where it's at.</em>&quot; You sit on your bed, nibbling a strudel.</p> <p>&quot;I'd call you lucky, but I'd be a bit of a hypocrite, since, you know.&quot; Tom stares down at the pendant on his chest. &quot;Lived most of my life under Blanche's wing.&quot; He takes a seat on the bed by your side, pulling out a small box from his pocket. &quot;Enough talk,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;We have a score to settle.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Pff, we both know how this ends,</em>&quot; you reply, slightly loosening your mask. &quot;<em>The Lady may have taught you a myriad of things, but beating me at Blackjack? Ha, good luck.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh, I know that.&quot; You notice his grin growing, little by little. &quot;Which is why I brought something a little different this time. When's the last time you played UNO? I swung by <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-389">389</a> on the way here- <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-99">Penelope</a> lent me this.&quot; Tom shuffles the cards as he speaks. His hands work with the cards with great comfort and speed, each card slipping in between the other with ease. &quot;Don't worry, I checked beforehand if the self-proclaimed Game Master didn't pull any of her tricks with this deck.&quot;</p> <p>You chuckle, a spark of anticipation igniting in your chest. &quot;<em>As long as it doesn't end like the last time, with Candyland.</em>&quot;</p> <p>Talking and playing with Tom had felt like a release from the constant sense of duty. The funniest part about it was the fact that you could hardly remember when it first started. You watch fondly as he works with the deck.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, wait, hold up.&quot; Tom stops dealing cards, looking around the room. &quot;Is it even safe to play cards here? You can't see it because of the mask, so you guys must've forgotten about it, but the whole place's still burning up. The heat feels so real, I almost forgot that the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294">level</a> isn't actually affected by it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Considering it hasn't gone up in flames yet, I can hope so.</em>&quot; you respond with a slight sense of guilt, lightly tapping his forehead. &quot;<em>Now that you're mentioning it, put your mask on, silly. You're lucky you're not a crispy nom-Tom right now! The fire may not affect the level, but it would most certainly affect you.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ugh, fine,&quot; he says, twirling the mask around his finger a few times before placing it on his face. You notice a faint hint of sadness on the tone, one that quickly vanished once he finishes dealing seven cards to you both. &quot;<em>You can go first.</em>&quot;</p> <p>The card at the center was a yellow six.</p> <p>You stare at Tom. He focuses on his cards. You wonder if he's hiding a good card behind that grin of his, or if he's hiding something else&#8230; You play your card, a yellow eight, smiling a little bit. It's been ages since you last had a moment like this.</p> <p>He plays a green eight, then you, a green two. Tension seems to grow between you as you start noticing a lack of black cards in his hand—you feel a strange sense of excitement and anticipation. Within a moment, after a few plays, you realize he has no blues. With 2 cards left, you feel like you're just about to win, until—</p> <p>&quot;<em>Let's see how you handle this one, Eve</em>,&quot; he says with a smirk, placing down a wild card that had a blank center. You think back to the last time you played Uno, which was just before you no-clipped during the car ride home—5, almost 6 years ago. No matter how much you thought about it, you couldn't remember a card like this being in the deck.</p> <p>&quot;<em>What's this one meant to be for?</em>&quot; You ask, voice laced with suspicion as you squint your eyes.</p> <p>Tom rearranges his hand, then sets them face down on the velvet mattress. &quot;<em>It's a white wild card. When someone places it down, you're allowed to make your own house rule.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Huh.</em>&quot; You say. &quot;<em>Alright then. What is it, then?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>You answer a question of mine, any question. If not, draw half the deck.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Half the deck? Or a simple question?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Eh, wouldn't say simple.</em>&quot; He taps the red comforters a few times. &quot;<em>So, are you gonna answer?</em>&quot;</p> <p>You put your cards down this time, crossing your arms confidently. &quot;<em>Fine, I will. What's your question?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>How are <strong>you</strong> doing? And I don't mean Madame Evangeline Holmes, I mean <strong>you</strong>, the person beneath that fancy mask of yours.</em>&quot;</p> <p>The smile that was on your face falls for a moment before you catch it and return to your cheerful demeanor. &quot;<em>How else would I be doing other than well? My people have made grand leaps in research, they're all still safe, and I'm playing Uno with a wonderful friend of mine. Clearly, I'm doing- I'm doing fine-</em>&quot; Your voice hitches and falters at the last sentence.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Really? I don't know, Evie, it's hard to believe you with that tone of yours.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Oh, fine.</em>&quot; You sigh softly, your smile slowly fading. You could ever so slightly feel the flames of the theatre's fire tickling your sleeves, a warmth you tried constantly to suppress. &quot;<em>I suppose I'm&#8230; well I'm tired. I've kept myself at the back of my people—but I've been doing&#8230; far more than I should endure. I just don't want my people to think I use them as a shield of some sort, you know?</em>&quot;</p> <p>Seeing you had answered honestly, Tom's expression softens. &quot;<em>I see&#8230;</em>&quot; He didn't seem to be paying much attention to the cards anymore, as evident by his cards falling to the carpet as he scoots closer to you. He pauses for a moment, considering his next words. &quot;<em>Ever notice how you keep straying back to 'your people?' I get it, they're extremely important to you&#8230; Though, I can't help but feel you're worrying too much. Being here so often probably isn't helping, either.</em>&quot;</p> <p>You stare at the pile of cards at the top of the bed. Though they were stable and unmoving, multiple of them were off to the sides, their positions off kilter. <em>Maybe he's right,</em> you think.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Mm. I have an idea.</em>&quot; Tom jumps out of bed, grabbing your wrist with a sly grin growing on his face. &quot;<em>Come on. I wanna take you somewhere.</em>&quot;</p> <p>You choose not to say much—not like you could refuse, anyway—as he takes you to the door. He peeks out, making sure no one was around, then slipping outside; across the hallways of the Dressing Rooms, and through the massive auditorium of the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294">Liminary Theatre</a>. Somehow, he weaves through the place, avoiding other Maidens who were talking and working in the seats as you both pass by.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Where are you taking me?</em>&quot; You ask with a slightly impatient, worried tone, tugging at his sleeve.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Relax, I'm not taking you anywhere dangerous.</em>&quot; He looks back at you with a look of reassurance. You roll your eyes, turning back at the other Maidens, who were all busy with their tasks. You finally make it outside of the theatre and behind the building, where no one seemed to be around.</p> <p>You see him pull a small notebook from his pocket, noticing Blanche's signature on the first page. Much to your surprise, he skips over it, quickly flipping through the notebook until he finds a rather complex-looking sigil. Shortly after, an exact copy of the sigil hovers above Tom's hand like an aurora. Cautiously, he places it on the floor and grabs your wrist again. Before you could say a word, the light pulls the both of you in, the world around you turning to white, and then&#8230;</p> <p>&quot;<em>We've arrived. Blanche calls the place the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-797">Path Less Traveled</a>. Ain't it gorgeous?</em>&quot;</p> <p>You take a few seconds to recover, slowly opening your eyes and quietly observing your surroundings. You stand on a gravel path, surrounded by dense vegetation. Vines creep up the nearby trees; flowers glitter the soft grass and beams of sunlight breach through the clouds above.</p> <p>You mutter a &quot;<em>Gorgeous indeed,</em>&quot; as you indulge in the sight. You turn to Tom, who also looks at you after taking his mask off, a look of satisfaction on his face. You can't help but smile for real. &quot;<em>Thank you.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Don't thank me yet, Eve,&quot; he says in return, sitting down on a rather large rock. &quot;But, while we're at it, we're alone right now and not in a mask station. Why don't you take off your mask?&quot;</p> <p>Your expression falters. <em>He can't know. Not yet.</em></p> <p><em>What will happen if he finds out? That your world had already plunged into darkness?</em>&quot;</p> <p>Quiet, near unintelligible whispers dance in your mind. You feel your head burn, which forces you to close your eyes for a moment. Opening them again, you find this world, so previously filled with comfort and serenity, glowing a dark crimson hue. The shock quickly dissipates and replaces itself with a brewing fear when you realize what is happening. The bright, lively flowers that adorned the ground are now brittle and dead; the sun merely a faint, light red. Just barely, you could hear the crackle of flames. Tom smiled still, awaiting your answer.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Maybe next time.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well, can't say I didn't try. You sure you're ok, Evie?&quot; Tom twirls his mask around his fingers before storing it away in a pocket. His voice is deep, echoing as if the two of you were locked in a large, empty chamber. &quot;You look kinda spaced out.&quot;</p> <p><em>He has no eyes.</em> &quot;<em>Oh, I'm alright. Just taking in some inspiration, for the next time I draw.</em>&quot; <em>Please, stop smiling.</em></p> <p>&quot;Why don't we stay awhile, then?&quot;</p> <p>You rub your eyes, the view not going away soon enough. <em>Push through it. Push through it. Please push through it,</em> you beg silently.</p> <p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p> <p>You sit next to one another, talking about everything your minds could think of—things you both had done before—but felt far, far different now. The laughter seems to fill the level, despite being outdoors. You wish it could last forever.</p> <p>There was a moment of silence after, as you both take a breath from laughing so much. At that moment, you get up and hug him tightly.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Thank you, Tom Von Haderach.</em>&quot; You stutter, trying to find the right words to say. &quot;<em>For being a part of this Maiden's life.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Woah, where'd that come from?&quot; His question is soaked in a playful, joking tone you'd grown used to hearing from Tom. It, however, fails to the surprise you were sure he feels, &quot;Jokes aside though,&quot; he said, returning the hug, &quot;I'm glad to be of service.&quot;</p> <p>You sigh and breathe deeply, shutting your eyes. As your eyelids flutter open, the deep ruby clouds vanish from the sky above, revealing a canvas painted in azure.</p> <p>Tom gets up, hopping off the rock. &quot;Man, I completely forgot I wanted to show you around the place!&quot; He stretches his hand out toward you. You take it, accepting his help to climb down from the rock—it was exceptionally difficult in heels.</p> <p>He checks his pocket watch and sighs slightly. &quot;I don't have the time to show you everything&#8230; what a bummer. Welp, guess I'll have to settle for the next best thing. Follow me! You're gonna love the view from up there,&quot; he points toward a nearby mountain. &quot;It's not a hard climb, there's a path that takes you straight to the top without much trouble.&quot;</p> <p>You grin, squeezing his hand just a little. &quot;<em>Alright, as long as I don't end up falling to my death.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Har har,&quot; he responds, walking to the path of the mountain; past the rocks and vegetation; the forest, and up the mountain. Eventually, you grow tired of walking; you slip off your shoes to ease the discomfort, cringing at the feel of gravel. All that time within indoor stations has affected your comfortability, it seems. &quot;You sure you don't want me to carry you?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>You can carry me when I'm dead, Tom,</em>&quot; you say with a groan, trying to keep pace. It wasn't long until you finally make your way up the mountain, the entrance to its peak covered by leaf-ridden branches.</p> <p>&quot;Do me a solid favor and close your eyes, will you?&quot; Tom smiles, looking back at you.</p> <p>&quot;<em>You better not push me off the mountain</em>,&quot; you say jokingly.</p> <p>&quot;I won't, I won't, not yet at least.&quot; The two of you laugh.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Fine, I'll do it.</em>&quot; Reluctantly, you close your eyes.</p> <p>&quot;This is gonna be worth the hassle, I promise.&quot; You let Tom drive you through the rest of the path, listening to the shaking of leaves and the crunch of gravel.</p> <p>A few moments later, he breaks the silence. &quot;Alright, you can open them! How's the view? You can see everything from up here! The dam, the forest outpost, and if you squint hard enough you can even see the bay in the distance!&quot;</p> <p>You take into view the waves of the bay lightly crashing into shore and the dam that took up quite a part of the level. The forest catches your eye the most—it was a striking hue of emerald, and you could just hear the chitter of whatever animals could be within. A small gasp leaves you, almost wondering why the place wasn't considered a tourist attraction.</p> <p>&quot;One day,&quot; he says, &quot;we'll explore it all. Just you and me! We can draw maps, and camp, and tell stories around the campfire…&quot;</p> <p>As he continues to speak, his voice fades away. Your heart begins to feel as if anvils were weighing down on it. &quot;<em>I don't know if I'll be able to do that, Tom&#8230;</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Huh? Why not?&quot; he asks, with a hint of sadness.</p> <p>You quickly switch up your tone. &quot;<em>I don't mean I don't want to do that, I just mean—with everything I need to do with the Maidens—it may take longer than you're willing to wait.</em>&quot;</p> <p>His expression changes, turning into a soft smile. &quot;So? You're one of my best friends. I'm more than willing to wait.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Huh.</em>&quot; You feel yourself grow more cheery. &quot;<em>Right.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Besides,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;We both know you should take more breaks. I can teach you how to get here if you want someplace away from all the Maiden stuff. You need to promise me something, though. Do not bring anyone else with you. It could be dangerous to have multiple people here for all I know, and that's a risk I don't want to take.&quot;</p> <p>You point at your mask, laughing a little as you say, &quot;<em>With this mask? Ha. Hardly a break.</em>&quot; You tighten the lace around your ponytail. &quot;<em>And of course, I promise. You have my word.</em>&quot;</p> <p>The both of you smile. &quot;Good.&quot; He sighed as he looks back at his pocket watch. &quot;Well, I'm afraid our time's almost up. It's almost tea time.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Aw</em>,&quot; You say with disappointment. &quot;<em>To think we couldn't even finish our game.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Pfft, don't you worry,&quot; he responds, putting his hands on his hips. &quot;That isn't over yet&#8230; now that you mention that mask, though&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>You watch the smile vanish from Tom's face like a wave.</p> <p>&quot;I decided to see if I could find anything about them on the Cygnus Archive. I ended up reading a ton on the topic. There are a few things I don't understand, but those can wait, they're not why I'm telling you this. How long has it been since you last took that mask off, Evie?&quot;</p> <p>You frown, looking away. &quot;<em>Hasn't been&#8230; too long&#8230;.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<strong>Evie.</strong>&quot; He repeats with sternness, placing a firm hand on your shoulder. &quot;How long?&quot;</p> <p>You fall silent, fidgeting with your fingers. &quot;<em>Not since the second Resistance.</em>&quot;</p> <p>Tom took a deep breath. &quot;Feel like I'm asking a stupid question here, but you are familiar with the Excess Effect, aren't you? Bloody hell&#8230; the second Resistance? That was so long ago. How are you still holding up? I'm worried, Evie. Worried that whatever's left of you gets lost behind that mask.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Pfff,</em>&quot; You try to laugh. &quot;<em>I have my ways.</em>&quot;</p> <p>He didn't look any less worried. &quot;You may have your ways, but it's still concerning either way, Evie. I mean&#8230; can you even take it off on your own will?&quot;</p> <p>Your tone grew sharper as you flip away your brown hair. &quot;<em>I haven't tried. And as far as I'm certain, I don't need to try—I can't try. Not with everything going on.</em>&quot;</p> <p>Tom sighs, running a hand through his. &quot;If you really insist on that, I won't push it. Just&#8230; take care of yourself, okay? Please. Who knows what'd happen if that double-edged sword of yours finally lands a fatal hit on you.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>I— I will. Don't worry about it.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;&#8230;right. &#8230;Why can't I believe you?&quot; He sits down on a nearby rock, staring you dead in the eyes. &quot;You're hiding something, I can tell that much. So, how's it gonna be? You feel like talking to someone sometime soon, or are you going to let it drag you down to the Grave?&quot;</p> <p>You scoff a small bit, trying to shrug it off. &quot;<em>Don't you have somewhere to be?</em>&quot;</p> <p>He crosses his arms in defense. &quot;I'm sure Blanche can wait since it's about you.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Can't I just tell you some other time when, y'know, neither of us are busy?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That's not how this works, Evie.&quot; A brow is raised, his tone almost impatient.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Sure it does, it happens all the time-</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You're still dodging the question&#8230; look, after we're done, you can ask me anything in return. Alright? But for now, this is about <strong>you</strong>,&quot; he says, tapping your forehead. &quot;Worst case scenario, I'll just shut up and listen. I promise.&quot;</p> <p>You sigh, rubbing your forehead and giving in. &quot;<em>Fine&#8230; How do I even—why don't I just&#8230; show you?</em>&quot; He tilts his head slightly as you gesture to the mask in his pocket. &quot;<em>Put your mask on.</em>&quot;</p> <p>Confused, he puts the mask on. &quot;Eugh, could never get used to this thing. So, what do we do now?&quot;</p> <p>You stare into his eyes, then close yours, channeling your θέαμα Colombina. However, instead of seeing into his vision, you allow him to see into yours. In a moment, you loosen your self-control, allowing your emotions to swirl and overwhelm you. Anger&#8230; despair&#8230; desolation. You open your eyes, and the sky changes once again to a blood red, only deeper and vibrant in hue. You see Tom gasp, and you know he saw that he lacked eyes. Your head aches.</p> <p>Tom, unable to endure it, tears his mask off, breathing deeply. &quot;What,&quot; he said in-between breaths, &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>I don't usually see it when I'm around other Maidens, but&#8230; I just couldn't hold it back this time.</em>&quot; You say, suddenly growing lightheaded. &quot;<em>It's the E.E.Ls. They've gone too high. By the time I've realized&#8230; it was too late. I can't take it off anymore.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What&#8230;?&quot; His face grows grim. &quot;Why didn't— why didn't you tell me?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>I didn't want you to harm yourself finding a solution for me</em>,&quot; you say, almost desperately. &quot;<em>I know you, Tom—you'll do whatever it takes—</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;And? What about you, Evie? Just- damn it!&quot; Tom sounds angry for a moment, standing up and punching a nearby rock. It leaves a dent in the rock, with small drops of blood staining it and the ground. &quot;Why didn't I get around to this sooner? There's got to be something that can be done, and I swear I'm gonna find it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>No, see, that's what I'm talking about,</em>&quot; The volume of your voice rises as you try going up to him. &quot;<em>You can't. At least—at least not right now.</em>&quot;</p> <p>He turns to look at you with a frustration in his eyes that almost scares you. His breaths become quick, his face flushed. &quot;And then what? I'm just supposed to let- to let this happen until I realize it's too late, that you've lost your mind permanently? That you could kill yourself? Huh? Tell me!&quot;</p> <p>There comes a moment of silence. You hear the wind howling nearby, dragging a few leaves through the air. Tom breaks the quiet with a small sigh. You look down, unable to keep your tears from falling.</p> <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; he says finally, his voice softer now. He hugs you, rubbing your back. It only makes you cry harder. &quot;I'm sorry&#8230; alright? I guess we both got a little overwhelmed, huh&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>A chuckle comes in between cries. You think you hear a sniffle. Quietly, you apologize, and many times until Tom stops you from doing so. You both sit back down, looking out at the view.</p> <p>&quot;<em>I think we've been here a tad too long,</em>&quot; you mention, fiddling with the straps of your heels.</p> <p>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Tom replies, scoffing amusingly. &quot;I'm so screwed.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Not like you cared earlier.</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Har har,&quot; he says sarcastically, rolling his eyes.</p> <p>You sit up straight, looking at him. &quot;<em>You said I could ask you anything if I answered you, right?</em>&quot;</p> <p>He sighs in response. &quot;Yeah. What's your question, then?&quot;</p> <p>You prepare yourself with a pause, almost wanting to withdraw from saying it. &quot;<em>If I die&#8230; could you help the Leading Maidens watch over the others for me?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Like hell I'm letting you die anytime soon, Evie.&quot; Tom frowns, crossing his legs.</p> <p>&quot;<em>It's not like I'm planning to, just—please just answer,</em>&quot; you plead.</p> <p>&quot;&#8230;Alright. I will. That's a worry for some other time, though. I'm going to tell Blanche about this. If there's anyone who can find a solution, it's probably her&#8230;&quot; You watch him scoot over to you before hugging you again. &quot;For now, just&#8230; take care, okay? Try to at least.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>Right. I'll give it my all.</em>&quot; You yawn, stretching as you pull away. &quot;<em>How long have we been here for?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Eh,&quot; he replies, looking at his pocket watch for the third time. &quot;Not tooooo long. Just long enough for what would be a 2-hour lecture from Blanche.&quot; The two of you laugh at the thought.</p> <p>You gaze one last time at the landscape before turning back, ready to return home. &quot;<em>We really should get going, no?</em>&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yup. C'mon,&quot; he says. &quot;I'll take you home. I'm late to tea anyway, and I feel like we could end this on a different note.&quot; He scratched the back of his head. &quot;Besides, I think I have a pretty good excuse for being this late,&quot; he adds with a smile.</p> <p>He offers you his hand, which you take. He asks you to close your eyes again and he leads you back down the mountain, through the gravel path, and eventually back to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294">Level μ</a>.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Thank you for today</em>,&quot; You say as you both enter your room, sitting down on the bed. &quot;<em>Even if things got a little&#8230; well, you know</em>.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Heated?&quot; He laughs for a little. &quot;Sorry, couldn't resist making the pun. No need to thank me, though. Glad to be of service,&quot; he bows. &quot;I'll be sure to drop by again sometime soon, and next time, maybe we could have an actual game of UNO without the gimmicks? I kinda lied about checking the deck for the Game Master's tricks&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>&quot;<em>I could tell</em>,&quot; a light chuckle leaves you. &quot;<em>I'll be waiting for that next time, Tom. Probably won't be any time soon, judging by the lecture you've got coming</em>.&quot;</p> <p>The two of you chuckle before saying goodbye. You watch him leave and your expression falters. Alone again. <em>Ah well,</em> you think. Another day will come, surely.</p> <p>You look back at the cart, which had been left untouched since you and Tom left the Level.</p> <p>You ought to put it back.</p> <p>&quot;<em>Psst</em>.&quot; You hear a familiar voice coming from behind you. &quot;<em>I forgot these masks could do this!</em>&quot; It's Tom, again. &quot;<em>Just wanted to say that no, you're not alone in this. I'm still here. Probably won't be having my mask on all the time, but if you need something, you know where to find me, okay</em>?&quot;</p> <p>You smile. &quot;<em>Okay, Tom</em>.&quot; You feel the link between your minds disappear.</p> <p>You take a bite out of one of the pastries in the cart.</p> <p>Maybe putting it back can wait.</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Written by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7331266&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="SnomWriting" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7331266)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting" >SnomWriting</a></span> and <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="TrailmixNCocoa" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa" >TrailmixNCocoa</a></span></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7331266&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713137" alt="SnomWriting" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7331266)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting" >SnomWriting</a></span></p>

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 06, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here it is. The end of the story. I rushed out of the room, stuffing the letter inside of my pocket. My mind was still clouded with thoughts of what had just happened. All I could think about was getting to Janice. I stomped down the stairs at full speed, nearly tripping over myself in the process. I probably should’ve slowed down, but I had no time to waste. The rush of the purple accents, baby blue walls, and the blurry faces of the Maidens hit my eyes like fireworks. I was only focused on one thing, and that was finding her. I was determined to complete my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone glanced at me as I sprinted by, wondering what on Earth had gotten into me. Some tried to tell me to slow down, or even downright stop me to ask questions. I didn’t care about what they had to say. I didn’t even have the time to listen. All I cared about was pushing forward, and nothing was going to stand in my way. She is what brought me back to life from my long dusted corpse of sorrow. I could not stop now. I eventually ran into a few Maidens by accident, who told me to watch my step; I continued as if nothing happened. The adrenaline rushing through my veins made each of the crashes painless. I tuned out their aggravation, only muttering a quick “sorry” under my breath before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then reached a corner next to our data center. As I hastily drifted across the wooden panel flooring, I fixated my sight onto something down the hallway. There was a woman that had darted out of the data center who immediately caught my attention. I observed her features: long blue cloak… Pantalone Mask… It had to be Janice. The other Maidens began yelling as they were alerted to her sudden appearance. My suspicions were confirmed at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few tears fell from my eyes as I met her gaze. I needed to get to her as fast as I could. I needed to save her. As soon as she noticed me, she quickly dashed across the hall in a desperate attempt to escape. &lt;em&gt;Was &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-85&quot;&gt;the creature&lt;/a&gt; really afraid of me?&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. &lt;em&gt;Did it know that I wanted to cure her from its disease?&lt;/em&gt; These were some of the many questions that arose during the chase. However, it did not stall me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued onward in my attempt to rescue her. As she ran further and further, the surrounding Maidens had joined me in the chase once they saw her, in pursuit of both of us. She ran gracefully, avoiding every obstacle in her wake; I was amazed. I kept bumping into Maiden after Maiden, furniture after furniture. She had gotten so far that I started to think I had failed her, or that I had lost. That was until a group of Maidens blocked her only exit. This was my chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally caught up to her, cornered by the other Maidens. It was time to finally confront the rotten creature which had been lingering inside of my true love once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As soon as she saw me heading her way, she spoke to me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; W- wait! It&#039;s not&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I had gotten to her and had given her a long hug.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Shhh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; N- no&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s okay. I will help you get rid of-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; No! Actually stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(At first, I took those words as the creature deceiving me until the voice started to sound&amp;#8230; different.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;m here now. You can be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I slowly reached for her mask and proceeded to take it off&amp;#8230; that was until everything changed.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Just stop! Get off me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I jolted back in shock from what stood before me, and from what I had done.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; W- wh- wait! I-uhh- but- a-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; well you caught me. I hope you&#039;re happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; But y- you look- looked just like her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; That was the point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8230; I- I don&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; You didn&#039;t know? I&#039;m the spy! There&#039;s no way I&#039;m saving myself from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You but&amp;#8230; then why&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did I dress up as her? I took her strange actions during the party as an opportunity to disguise myself in order to spy on all of you. We have the same mask after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I couldn&#039;t believe what was happening in front of me. I was shaking from the fact that Janice might not even be here anymore. More tears continuously flown down my face. I struggled to convey my words and feelings. I couldn&#039;t hold in my sadness and anger.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You- you fucking traitor! M- murderer!-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Traitor? Maybe, but I&#039;m no killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; The M.E.G. is wh- what started the Maidens from the horrors of their experiments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you even think we want to do that? No, we don&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Then why do it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s for the sake of humanity! But now we have to save innocent wanderers from people like you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Then wh- why did you save me that night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; To show you that we still care!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Was her saving me just a trick? Maybe it was to prove a point. I did not care.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Was it you that put th- that thing into her?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you?&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; The fucking snake! Did you do it?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#039;t even know what you&#039;re talking about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So you didn&#039;t do it to her?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; We never had anything planed for her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(At this point I could barely breathe. So many emotions wanted to explode out of me like a volcano. Unable to hold myself together any longer, I let out a scream of agony.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You will&amp;#8230; pay for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Pfft. Paying the price for saving humanity. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As The Maidens then started to take her away, I made a remark as they were taking Mackie to her trial.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I bet that entire thing about your brother was a lie too&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;No&amp;#8230; I would never&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, distraught. My efforts to save Janice were all in vain. She wasn&#039;t there at all. She had left &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Level 67&lt;/a&gt; long ago. &lt;em&gt;Was this all just a coincidence? Had the creature invaded her body by chance?&lt;/em&gt; I began to ponder these questions in my head as The Maidens grabbed my arms and held them behind my back. Once I was successfully detained, they lead me along to the interrogation room. The Maidens then offered me to write a letter to another Maiden. I never spoke a word. Then there I was, tied up to a chair in a questioning room. A Volto-wearer peeked in to inform me that my interviewer would be arriving shortly before closing the door once more, leaving me alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just sat there, staring into space. My body was frozen still, focused. Only one word could describe my thoughts and feelings at that moment: determination. My eyes then attracted to one feature in the room&amp;#8230; the ceiling vent. I knew it could be dangerous, but this might have been my only chance to find her. I had to get out, but I didn&#039;t know what to do. That was until I felt something in my back pocket, the pencil. I pulled it out, and began using the tip to try and collapse the integrity of the poorly-crafted rope, hardly even tied tightly. After poking the pencil through the weaves of the rope a few times, the rope began to fall apart, loosening it just enough for me to slip out. As soon as I broke free, I pushed the table over towards the vent, and climbed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vent could&#039;ve lead me to my demise, but luckily for me that would not be my fate. It had brought me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt;. As I sighed of relief, I made my way through the ghostly office halls. I didn&#039;t know where to go, but I knew I had to go somewhere. I had lost track of time after hours of wandering, but I knew that multiple hours had to have passed by this point. As I slowly started to lose hope, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182&quot;&gt;Masked Messenger&lt;/a&gt; suddenly flew towards me with its colorful beauty. It dropped another envelope into the palms of my hands. As it glided its way home, I opened the envelope. It read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Customfont&quot;&gt;It looks like you&#039;ll be needing this. I hope you find what you are looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Customfont&quot;&gt;Good luck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a beautiful, bright-blue ball of light emerged from the letter, levitating above it. A similar ball of light to the one that brought me home in my first mission. I watched in awe as this magical experience occurred before my eyes. The ball began to hover through the halls of Level 4, seemingly leading the way to something. After a while of following it, I was eventually led to an old wooden staircase. I then walked up the stairs, still following the orb, until I eventually reached what appeared to be an old hotel. A female &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4&quot;&gt;Deathmoth&lt;/a&gt; flew by me as I took in the scenery. It looked like I was in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5&quot;&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wandered the halls of the hotel of terror, I noticed how beautiful it was, its imperfections. We all have imperfections, it&#039;s the beauty in all. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4&quot;&gt;Deathmoths&lt;/a&gt; were still an annoyance, but thankfully they didn’t attack anything beyond my hearing. The smooth jazz emitting from the speakers, while broken, was soothing after all that had happened. At one point I thought I heard people on the other side of the wall&amp;#8230; but it slowly faded back into silence before I could get close enough to track the source of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how interesting or satisfying this really was, it all felt like&amp;#8230; distractions. I needed to keep my pace. The blue light was still moving through the mahogany-red and gold ornate walls. It was mesmerizing. That was until it went around a corner&amp;#8230; then it had just disappeared. I went into a panic. &lt;em&gt;Did the light reach its destination?&lt;/em&gt; I turned the corner&amp;#8230; and I froze&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was too late&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was on the floor&amp;#8230; Gone&amp;#8230; Her body was black and blue, covered as if she was bruised. Her veins were purple too&amp;#8230; I ran to her&amp;#8230; collapsing on the floor in tears from what I was witnessing&amp;#8230; I held her already cold corpse, cradling her in my arms&amp;#8230; I didn&#039;t want to let go&amp;#8230; I screamed in agony once more. I had failed her. &lt;em&gt;Why did this have to happen? Why couldn&#039;t we be together?&lt;/em&gt; She never deserved this. &lt;em&gt;Do I deserve this?&lt;/em&gt; I didn&#039;t know&amp;#8230; I still don&#039;t. I wanted to end it all, but she wanted me to live on, and I couldn’t fail her more than I already did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there for what felt like hours&amp;#8230; That was until I saw her mask&amp;#8230; I took it off of her body and stared at it, reminiscing the memories I had with her. I was crying so much, I was sweating from it. I couldn&#039;t even breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then placed her mask on my face&amp;#8230; I wore it to try feeling her once more&amp;#8230; I didn&#039;t know what I was doing. That was until&amp;#8230; I heard a voice, which said to me&amp;#8230; &amp;quot;Kyra?&amp;quot; It sounded like her. I looked back to see her withering corpse&amp;#8230; no movement. I then heard the voice again&amp;#8230; &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot;&amp;#8230; all my emotions came through me all at once. They exploded in a flash of color. I cried again, placing my head on her chest. I asked if it really was her. She then said&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&#039;s me. It&#039;s okay now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried tears of joy&amp;#8230; Maybe this was the way it was meant to be&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can be together forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then lifted the mask slightly to slowly kiss her on the forehead. I walked away with her mask. She was still in there. We can still talk to each other, we can still be with each other. I placed my old mask on a nearby wall. I stared at it for a second, thinking about where I ended up now&amp;#8230; I still wish she was alive. I won&#039;t be able to hold her, or do any physical interactions. But, this is way better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then made my way back to The Maidens, where I was immediately detained for them to continue their interrogation to see if I was apart of this issue. I told them the truth, and they noticed that I had Janice&#039;s mask, so they let me free. It turns out&amp;#8230; Mackie was the one that sent me the letter to find Janice before she got locked away. She did it to show that she cared. In my eyes, she is forgiven, but The M.E.G. will never be forgiven. Unfortunately&amp;#8230; Mackie will be locked away in a cell by The Maidens for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the end of this story then&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main lesson to learn here is&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens in your life, no matter how lonely you are, no matter who you are, don&#039;t end your own life from it&amp;#8230; because&amp;#8230; love will find you someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is inevitable. No matter who you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will be loved forever, no matter what happens&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8230; is the message. I hope you keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice, here&#039;s your mask. Thank you for letting me use it today. Janice is waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening to my story. I hope to see you again someday, whoever you are. I need to go back to my duties. I wish you a great day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an audio recording of Masked Maidens Members Kyra Haywood and Sullivan Vanderlyn while on a scout patrol in Level 5. Reports of a masked wanderer had been surfacing within The Maidens for a few days prior. Here&#039;s what was found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The Team had reached an Eternal Ball Room within Level 5.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Heheh… never seen a circus quite like this one! There&#039;s enough whispers here to make you sound like me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I guess you could put it that way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Haha! Yeah! You could put it in many ways! More ways then none! Or you could just not put it in a way at all. Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ha! I mean, putting everything into a perspective is a pretty nice way to look at the world, y&#039;know?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Heh, I guess you could say that! I put my perspective iiiiiiinn&amp;#8230; Myself! Because who else would even care?! I don&#039;t!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t be too hard on yourself. You have people that care for you: Like The Maidens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gah! They only see me as a distraction to make a silent party. You are really the only thing I have left after uhh&amp;#8230; yeah&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t worry, Janice still cares for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ahh perfect! I’ve been cared for by my imaginary friends before, but never a real ghost!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Footsteps can be heard not emitting from the Team.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shh! Hear that?.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;All I heard was shhh!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shush.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And now I heard &#039;shush&#039; too!&amp;#8230; Oh look! There&#039;s the little newbie!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ohh!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A girl with a black dress and blonde hair walks up to them. She is wearing a Buskin Mask.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;??? &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh please! Tell me you are indeed what we were searching for!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mmhm! We were looking for you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;??? &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I suppose I shall introduce myself! I am Alice! You seem fairly familiar to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I do&amp;#8230;? Hmm. May I try something Alice?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of course!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Kyra then proceeds to take off Alice&#039;s mask)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! Wh- aaaaah! What was that thing?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Your mask&amp;#8230; but looking at it, this was mine. I remember placing my initials on it a long time ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Awww! C&#039;mon! You&#039;re telling me we wasted a year&#039;s worth of luck on this?! I could&#039;ve won the lottery! Hahaha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is pretty rare to happen, yeah! Alice, you should come with us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; No! I- I don&#039;t know! I&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Trust me, you&#039;ll be much safer there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; All of this is going so fast. I was just at my house, and all of a sudden I am here. And I find that&amp;#8230; mask!&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t know what to do anymore I&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We can give you a new home, a new place to stay. There are monsters here, but you&#039;ll be safe with us. You&#039;ll be safe with this..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Kyra then hands over the Buskin mask towards Alice.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; I- I don&#039;t&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please&amp;#8230;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Alice took the mask, and they made it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294&quot;&gt;Level 294&lt;/a&gt;. Kyra, Sullivan, and Alice are now one of the best field teams that the Maidens have, and are frequently sent on some of the more dangerous missions.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>June 06, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>Well, here it is. The end of the story. I rushed out of the room, stuffing the letter inside of my pocket. My mind was still clouded with thoughts of what had just happened. All I could think about was getting to Janice. I stomped down the stairs at full speed, nearly tripping over myself in the process. I probably should’ve slowed down, but I had no time to waste. The rush of the purple accents, baby blue walls, and the blurry faces of the Maidens hit my eyes like fireworks. I was only focused on one thing, and that was finding her. I was determined to complete my goal.</p> <p>Everyone glanced at me as I sprinted by, wondering what on Earth had gotten into me. Some tried to tell me to slow down, or even downright stop me to ask questions. I didn’t care about what they had to say. I didn’t even have the time to listen. All I cared about was pushing forward, and nothing was going to stand in my way. She is what brought me back to life from my long dusted corpse of sorrow. I could not stop now. I eventually ran into a few Maidens by accident, who told me to watch my step; I continued as if nothing happened. The adrenaline rushing through my veins made each of the crashes painless. I tuned out their aggravation, only muttering a quick “sorry” under my breath before continuing.</p> <p>I then reached a corner next to our data center. As I hastily drifted across the wooden panel flooring, I fixated my sight onto something down the hallway. There was a woman that had darted out of the data center who immediately caught my attention. I observed her features: long blue cloak… Pantalone Mask… It had to be Janice. The other Maidens began yelling as they were alerted to her sudden appearance. My suspicions were confirmed at that point.</p> <p>A few tears fell from my eyes as I met her gaze. I needed to get to her as fast as I could. I needed to save her. As soon as she noticed me, she quickly dashed across the hall in a desperate attempt to escape. <em>Was <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-85">the creature</a> really afraid of me?</em> I thought to myself. <em>Did it know that I wanted to cure her from its disease?</em> These were some of the many questions that arose during the chase. However, it did not stall me.</p> <p>I continued onward in my attempt to rescue her. As she ran further and further, the surrounding Maidens had joined me in the chase once they saw her, in pursuit of both of us. She ran gracefully, avoiding every obstacle in her wake; I was amazed. I kept bumping into Maiden after Maiden, furniture after furniture. She had gotten so far that I started to think I had failed her, or that I had lost. That was until a group of Maidens blocked her only exit. This was my chance.</p> <p>I finally caught up to her, cornered by the other Maidens. It was time to finally confront the rotten creature which had been lingering inside of my true love once and for all.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><em>(As soon as she saw me heading her way, she spoke to me.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> W- wait! It's not&#8212;</p> <p><em>(I had gotten to her and had given her a long hug.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Shhh.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> N- no&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> It's okay. I will help you get rid of-</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> No! Actually stop!</p> <p><em>(At first, I took those words as the creature deceiving me until the voice started to sound&#8230; different.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I'm here now. You can be safe.</p> <p><em>(I slowly reached for her mask and proceeded to take it off&#8230; that was until everything changed.)</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Just stop! Get off me!</p> <p><em>(I jolted back in shock from what stood before me, and from what I had done.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> W- wh- wait! I-uhh- but- a-</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Sigh&#8230;</em> well you caught me. I hope you're happy.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> But y- you look- looked just like her!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> That was the point!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I&#8230; I- I don't.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> You didn't know? I'm the spy! There's no way I'm saving myself from this.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You but&#8230; then why&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Why did I dress up as her? I took her strange actions during the party as an opportunity to disguise myself in order to spy on all of you. We have the same mask after all.</p> <p><em>(I couldn't believe what was happening in front of me. I was shaking from the fact that Janice might not even be here anymore. More tears continuously flown down my face. I struggled to convey my words and feelings. I couldn't hold in my sadness and anger.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You- you fucking traitor! M- murderer!-</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Traitor? Maybe, but I'm no killer.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> The M.E.G. is wh- what started the Maidens from the horrors of their experiments!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Do you even think we want to do that? No, we don't.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Then why do it!?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> It's for the sake of humanity! But now we have to save innocent wanderers from people like you!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Then wh- why did you save me that night?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> To show you that we still care!</p> <p><em>(Was her saving me just a trick? Maybe it was to prove a point. I did not care.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Was it you that put th- that thing into her?!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> What are you?&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> The fucking snake! Did you do it?!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> I don't even know what you're talking about!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So you didn't do it to her?!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> We never had anything planed for her!</p> <p><em>(At this point I could barely breathe. So many emotions wanted to explode out of me like a volcano. Unable to hold myself together any longer, I let out a scream of agony.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You will&#8230; pay for this.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Pfft. Paying the price for saving humanity. Right.</p> <p><em>(As The Maidens then started to take her away, I made a remark as they were taking Mackie to her trial.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I bet that entire thing about your brother was a lie too&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> &#8230;No&#8230; I would never&#8230;</p> </div> <hr /> <p>I stood there, distraught. My efforts to save Janice were all in vain. She wasn't there at all. She had left <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67">Level 67</a> long ago. <em>Was this all just a coincidence? Had the creature invaded her body by chance?</em> I began to ponder these questions in my head as The Maidens grabbed my arms and held them behind my back. Once I was successfully detained, they lead me along to the interrogation room. The Maidens then offered me to write a letter to another Maiden. I never spoke a word. Then there I was, tied up to a chair in a questioning room. A Volto-wearer peeked in to inform me that my interviewer would be arriving shortly before closing the door once more, leaving me alone.</p> <p>I just sat there, staring into space. My body was frozen still, focused. Only one word could describe my thoughts and feelings at that moment: determination. My eyes then attracted to one feature in the room&#8230; the ceiling vent. I knew it could be dangerous, but this might have been my only chance to find her. I had to get out, but I didn't know what to do. That was until I felt something in my back pocket, the pencil. I pulled it out, and began using the tip to try and collapse the integrity of the poorly-crafted rope, hardly even tied tightly. After poking the pencil through the weaves of the rope a few times, the rope began to fall apart, loosening it just enough for me to slip out. As soon as I broke free, I pushed the table over towards the vent, and climbed in.</p> <p>The vent could've lead me to my demise, but luckily for me that would not be my fate. It had brought me to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a>. As I sighed of relief, I made my way through the ghostly office halls. I didn't know where to go, but I knew I had to go somewhere. I had lost track of time after hours of wandering, but I knew that multiple hours had to have passed by this point. As I slowly started to lose hope, a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182">Masked Messenger</a> suddenly flew towards me with its colorful beauty. It dropped another envelope into the palms of my hands. As it glided its way home, I opened the envelope. It read as follows:</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="borderblock"> <p><span class="Customfont">It looks like you'll be needing this. I hope you find what you are looking for.</span></p> <p><span class="Customfont">Good luck.</span></p> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>Then, a beautiful, bright-blue ball of light emerged from the letter, levitating above it. A similar ball of light to the one that brought me home in my first mission. I watched in awe as this magical experience occurred before my eyes. The ball began to hover through the halls of Level 4, seemingly leading the way to something. After a while of following it, I was eventually led to an old wooden staircase. I then walked up the stairs, still following the orb, until I eventually reached what appeared to be an old hotel. A female <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4">Deathmoth</a> flew by me as I took in the scenery. It looked like I was in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Level 5</a>.</p> <p>As I wandered the halls of the hotel of terror, I noticed how beautiful it was, its imperfections. We all have imperfections, it's the beauty in all. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-4">Deathmoths</a> were still an annoyance, but thankfully they didn’t attack anything beyond my hearing. The smooth jazz emitting from the speakers, while broken, was soothing after all that had happened. At one point I thought I heard people on the other side of the wall&#8230; but it slowly faded back into silence before I could get close enough to track the source of the sound.</p> <p>No matter how interesting or satisfying this really was, it all felt like&#8230; distractions. I needed to keep my pace. The blue light was still moving through the mahogany-red and gold ornate walls. It was mesmerizing. That was until it went around a corner&#8230; then it had just disappeared. I went into a panic. <em>Did the light reach its destination?</em> I turned the corner&#8230; and I froze&#8230;</p> <p><strong>I was too late&#8230;</strong></p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>She was on the floor&#8230; Gone&#8230; Her body was black and blue, covered as if she was bruised. Her veins were purple too&#8230; I ran to her&#8230; collapsing on the floor in tears from what I was witnessing&#8230; I held her already cold corpse, cradling her in my arms&#8230; I didn't want to let go&#8230; I screamed in agony once more. I had failed her. <em>Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't we be together?</em> She never deserved this. <em>Do I deserve this?</em> I didn't know&#8230; I still don't. I wanted to end it all, but she wanted me to live on, and I couldn’t fail her more than I already did.</p> <p>I sat there for what felt like hours&#8230; That was until I saw her mask&#8230; I took it off of her body and stared at it, reminiscing the memories I had with her. I was crying so much, I was sweating from it. I couldn't even breathe.</p> <p>I then placed her mask on my face&#8230; I wore it to try feeling her once more&#8230; I didn't know what I was doing. That was until&#8230; I heard a voice, which said to me&#8230; &quot;Kyra?&quot; It sounded like her. I looked back to see her withering corpse&#8230; no movement. I then heard the voice again&#8230; &quot;I love you.&quot;&#8230; all my emotions came through me all at once. They exploded in a flash of color. I cried again, placing my head on her chest. I asked if it really was her. She then said&#8230;</p> <p>&quot;It's me. It's okay now.&quot;</p> <p>I cried tears of joy&#8230; Maybe this was the way it was meant to be&#8230;</p> <p><strong>We can be together forever.</strong></p> <p>I then lifted the mask slightly to slowly kiss her on the forehead. I walked away with her mask. She was still in there. We can still talk to each other, we can still be with each other. I placed my old mask on a nearby wall. I stared at it for a second, thinking about where I ended up now&#8230; I still wish she was alive. I won't be able to hold her, or do any physical interactions. But, this is way better than nothing.</p> <p>I then made my way back to The Maidens, where I was immediately detained for them to continue their interrogation to see if I was apart of this issue. I told them the truth, and they noticed that I had Janice's mask, so they let me free. It turns out&#8230; Mackie was the one that sent me the letter to find Janice before she got locked away. She did it to show that she cared. In my eyes, she is forgiven, but The M.E.G. will never be forgiven. Unfortunately&#8230; Mackie will be locked away in a cell by The Maidens for a long time.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>I guess this is the end of this story then&#8230;</p> <p>The main lesson to learn here is&#8230;</p> <p>No matter what happens in your life, no matter how lonely you are, no matter who you are, don't end your own life from it&#8230; because&#8230; love will find you someday.</p> <p><strong>Love is inevitable. No matter who you are.</strong></p> <p>And you will be loved forever, no matter what happens&#8230;</p> <p>And that&#8230; is the message. I hope you keep this in mind.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Alice, here's your mask. Thank you for letting me use it today. Janice is waiting for me.</p> <p>And&#8230;</p> <p>Thank you for listening to my story. I hope to see you again someday, whoever you are. I need to go back to my duties. I wish you a great day.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Access&nbsp;Maidens&nbsp;Mission&nbsp;Log&nbsp;308</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Welcome,&nbsp;dear&nbsp;Maiden.</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"></div> <div class="borderblock"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h2><span><strong>MASKED MAIDENS</strong></span></h2> <h3><span><strong>DATABASE</strong></span></h3> </div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p><span class="rainbow2">TO MASK IS TO REVEAL&#8230;</span></p> </div> <hr /> <div class="styled-quote"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong>Mission Log:</strong> 308</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Date:</strong> 7/29/2021</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Subject:</strong> New recruitment</td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>This is an audio recording of Masked Maidens Members Kyra Haywood and Sullivan Vanderlyn while on a scout patrol in Level 5.

You have people that care for you: Like The Maidens.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan &quot;Arlecchino&quot;:</strong> <em>Gah! They only see me as a distraction to make a silent party.

Hear that?.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan &quot;Arlecchino&quot;:</strong> <em>All I heard was shhh!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra &quot;Pantalone&quot;:</strong> <em>Shush.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan &quot;Arlecchino&quot;:</strong> <em>And now I heard 'shush' too!&#8230; Oh look!

				<title>The Snake Crawls Part 6: Why Must I Suffer...?</title>

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:300%;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The following contains graphic imagery including: &lt;strong&gt;SELF HARM&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ATTEMPTED SUICIDE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Viewer discretion is advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 05, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still that desperate night. Everything went silent. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens&quot;&gt;The Masked Maidens&lt;/a&gt; in disarray. I came to the Maidens thinking I had nothing left to lose, but as soon as I gained a purpose, I learnt that it was all a lie&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was too quiet. It felt like noise to me. I wanted it out. I wanted it to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to end&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be invisible like I once was before, to never be important, never be seen again; it all seemed like paradise to me. I slowly lifted my left sleeve&amp;#8230; to reveal all my mistakes. My deepest and darkest wounds that never healed. I struggled to take a deep breath, my pillow soaked with tears. I squeezed my arm, hoping to soothe it slightly from the pulsing pain: a stinging reminder that existing alone is… suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I thought I had was gone in a single moment. A flash of pain. The cold lies that been given to me all this time. No one cared&amp;#8230; I should&#039;ve known that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked to our painting. All the colors that were never true. A mess of deception. Was this just to get what she wanted? Did she use me? To show compassion&amp;#8230; and love, just to say that you never cared? It&#039;s cruelty. But that&#039;s what everything is&amp;#8230; it always was. The world is cruel. That will never change. Even if I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my desk, noticing a little pencil in the distance. I clutched a nearby sofa, pulling myself off the floor with what little will I had left. Tears flowed out like a fountain as I used everything I had just to walk across the room. Sitting on that desk was that little pencil. I knew that morbid fate finally stood in front of me, looking me dead in the eyes. I fell onto the seat behind the desk, picking up the pencil. My hand shook as I fiddled with it for a minute, looking deep into each and every one of its imperfections. I looked at its pointed tip. It was barely sharp enough to write on paper, but maybe it could work if I tried hard enough…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts of my life rushed through my head. Friends, family, The Maidens, it all came back to me. I looked at the tender side of my arm, seeing a bulging blue vein. I looked back to the pencil, my eyes clouded by tears. I clutched the pencil tightly, breathing heavily. I thrusted it onto the vein, accomplishing nothing but a slight poke. I smashed the vein again and again and again with the tip of the tiny pencil, hoping to break the skin, but I saw nothing except the stains of the graphite on my wrist. I threw the pencil to the wall, and I fell back onto the floor, slightly kicking the desk in front of me. I didn&#039;t even have the will to hurt myself anymore. I just laid there. Staring into space&amp;#8230; staring at nothing&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was until&amp;#8230; an envelope fell onto me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up, and saw her name in front of me… Janice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was angry, my hands dented the sides of the envelope as my hands turned into fists. I quickly ripped open the container, as if a lion was mauling a man to shreds. Then my anger&amp;#8230; turned back to sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of the envelope fell out onto the desk. It was a letter… from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oldpaper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Kyra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back from the start, a beat had skipped in my heart. The glee in your voice, the gleam in your eyes. It was all too perfect for me. I’ve never met someone like you, and I know you felt the same. You told me to look at the world with a perspective, I found a new introspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had given me a new view, and that&#039;s with me and you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things we&#039;ve been through, special things they taught me to pursue. This vision so new, I knew you&#039;ve seen it too. Without disruption, I knew we could stop this corruption. But away with the envision, to complete this mission. You filled me with happiness, if it wasn&#039;t obvious&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;#8230; even with our love to commend, it may be put to an end. This call for help is major, I am in grave danger. Without any warning in sight, my body was invaded by a parasite. For what I say here isn&#039;t fake, as what lies inside is &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-85&quot;&gt;a snake&lt;/a&gt;. One that deceives, without anything to receive. One that affects my mind, no matter how much I try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may tell you lies, but there is still something to find. This serpent does not affect my writing, and our love is worth fighting for. The parasite is spreading, the consequences are dreading. The wounds are only growing, which leaves me unsound. My heart is sinking, all too much to be thinking. My voice of truth is rusted, therefore I cannot be trusted. Heed my warnings, there isn&#039;t much time for mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know of your secret, all your wounds precut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hurt yourself, without effort to exert your stress. You feel as if you are unwanted, which leaves you daunted. You drive cuts to your wrist, believing that you shouldn&#039;t exist. Thinking it&#039;s a way to cope, leaving all hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&#039;t want you to do this anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to survive, find ways to deprive your darkness. Help our cause to stop the deception, put it all into conception. Starting tonight, I want your life to be full of delight. No more sadness, put an end to the madness. I believe in you, I always had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for a cure, to make me pure. Make that your goal, for soon my actions I will be unable to control. This is my last chance, don&#039;t make this our final dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter where we&#039;re headed, may our intrepid love never end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With love. - Janice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not know what to say. My body and mind couldn&#039;t comprehend what beautiful words were written. I was frozen, until I broke down. I was in tears of happiness. It wasn’t a lie, but true. She loved me. I have a purpose, I exist for a reason. I knew then it wasn&#039;t all for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;#8230; my tears of joy soon turned to sorrow. Janice was in danger. I needed to save her somehow. I need to find where she went. All this responsibility put onto my shoulders like weights. It was too much for my mind to handle&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t know what to do&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had to do something. I couldn&#039;t leave her to die after everything we&#039;ve been through. I slowly got up&amp;#8230; I was determined to find her. To save her. I quickly ran to the closet and took some of my gear. I was preparing for anything just to find her again so she can be safe in my arms. I took my mask, glancing back at our painting, saying to myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will find you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="borderblock"> <p><span style="font-size:300%;"><strong>WARNING:</strong></span><br /> The following contains graphic imagery including: <strong>SELF HARM</strong> and <strong>ATTEMPTED SUICIDE</strong>.<br /> Viewer discretion is advised.</p> </div> </div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>June 05, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>It was still that desperate night. Everything went silent. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens">The Masked Maidens</a> in disarray. I came to the Maidens thinking I had nothing left to lose, but as soon as I gained a purpose, I learnt that it was all a lie&#8230;</p> <p>It was too quiet. It felt like noise to me. I wanted it out. I wanted it to end.</p> <p>I&#8230;</p> <p><strong>I wanted to end&#8230;</strong></p> <p>To be invisible like I once was before, to never be important, never be seen again; it all seemed like paradise to me. I slowly lifted my left sleeve&#8230; to reveal all my mistakes. My deepest and darkest wounds that never healed. I struggled to take a deep breath, my pillow soaked with tears. I squeezed my arm, hoping to soothe it slightly from the pulsing pain: a stinging reminder that existing alone is… suffering.</p> <p>Everything I thought I had was gone in a single moment. A flash of pain. The cold lies that been given to me all this time. No one cared&#8230; I should've known that.</p> <p>I looked to our painting. All the colors that were never true. A mess of deception. Was this just to get what she wanted? Did she use me? To show compassion&#8230; and love, just to say that you never cared? It's cruelty. But that's what everything is&#8230; it always was. The world is cruel. That will never change. Even if I tried.</p> <p>I looked at my desk, noticing a little pencil in the distance. I clutched a nearby sofa, pulling myself off the floor with what little will I had left. Tears flowed out like a fountain as I used everything I had just to walk across the room. Sitting on that desk was that little pencil. I knew that morbid fate finally stood in front of me, looking me dead in the eyes. I fell onto the seat behind the desk, picking up the pencil. My hand shook as I fiddled with it for a minute, looking deep into each and every one of its imperfections. I looked at its pointed tip. It was barely sharp enough to write on paper, but maybe it could work if I tried hard enough…</p> <p>Thoughts of my life rushed through my head. Friends, family, The Maidens, it all came back to me. I looked at the tender side of my arm, seeing a bulging blue vein. I looked back to the pencil, my eyes clouded by tears. I clutched the pencil tightly, breathing heavily. I thrusted it onto the vein, accomplishing nothing but a slight poke. I smashed the vein again and again and again with the tip of the tiny pencil, hoping to break the skin, but I saw nothing except the stains of the graphite on my wrist. I threw the pencil to the wall, and I fell back onto the floor, slightly kicking the desk in front of me. I didn't even have the will to hurt myself anymore. I just laid there. Staring into space&#8230; staring at nothing&#8230;</p> <p>That was until&#8230; an envelope fell onto me&#8230;</p> <p>I picked it up, and saw her name in front of me… Janice.</p> <p>I was angry, my hands dented the sides of the envelope as my hands turned into fists. I quickly ripped open the container, as if a lion was mauling a man to shreds. Then my anger&#8230; turned back to sorrow.</p> <p>The contents of the envelope fell out onto the desk. It was a letter… from her.</p> <hr /> <div class="oldpaper"> <p>Dear Kyra.</p> <p>Back from the start, a beat had skipped in my heart. The glee in your voice, the gleam in your eyes. It was all too perfect for me. I’ve never met someone like you, and I know you felt the same. You told me to look at the world with a perspective, I found a new introspective.</p> <p><strong>You had given me a new view, and that's with me and you.</strong></p> <p>The things we've been through, special things they taught me to pursue. This vision so new, I knew you've seen it too. Without disruption, I knew we could stop this corruption. But away with the envision, to complete this mission. You filled me with happiness, if it wasn't obvious&#8230;</p> <p><strong>I love you.</strong></p> <p>But&#8230; even with our love to commend, it may be put to an end. This call for help is major, I am in grave danger. Without any warning in sight, my body was invaded by a parasite. For what I say here isn't fake, as what lies inside is <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-85">a snake</a>. One that deceives, without anything to receive. One that affects my mind, no matter how much I try.</p> <p>I may tell you lies, but there is still something to find. This serpent does not affect my writing, and our love is worth fighting for. The parasite is spreading, the consequences are dreading. The wounds are only growing, which leaves me unsound. My heart is sinking, all too much to be thinking. My voice of truth is rusted, therefore I cannot be trusted. Heed my warnings, there isn't much time for mourning.</p> <p><strong>I know of your secret, all your wounds precut.</strong></p> <p>You hurt yourself, without effort to exert your stress. You feel as if you are unwanted, which leaves you daunted. You drive cuts to your wrist, believing that you shouldn't exist. Thinking it's a way to cope, leaving all hope.</p> <p><strong>I don't want you to do this anymore.</strong></p> <p>I want you to survive, find ways to deprive your darkness. Help our cause to stop the deception, put it all into conception. Starting tonight, I want your life to be full of delight. No more sadness, put an end to the madness. I believe in you, I always had.</p> <p>But for me&#8230;</p> <p>Look for a cure, to make me pure. Make that your goal, for soon my actions I will be unable to control. This is my last chance, don't make this our final dance.</p> <p><strong>No matter where we're headed, may our intrepid love never end.</strong></p> <p>With love. - Janice</p> </div> <hr /> <p>I did not know what to say. My body and mind couldn't comprehend what beautiful words were written. I was frozen, until I broke down. I was in tears of happiness. It wasn’t a lie, but true. She loved me. I have a purpose, I exist for a reason. I knew then it wasn't all for nothing.</p> <p>Then&#8230; my tears of joy soon turned to sorrow. Janice was in danger. I needed to save her somehow. I need to find where she went. All this responsibility put onto my shoulders like weights. It was too much for my mind to handle&#8230;</p> <p>I didn't know what to do&#8230;</p> <p>But I had to do something. I couldn't leave her to die after everything we've been through. I slowly got up&#8230; I was determined to find her. To save her. I quickly ran to the closet and took some of my gear. I was preparing for anything just to find her again so she can be safe in my arms. I took my mask, glancing back at our painting, saying to myself:</p> <p><strong>I will find you.</strong></p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>The original author of this entry is <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713138" alt="Stretchsterz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" >Stretchsterz</a></span></p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <th colspan="2">Other Pages By This Author</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Levels</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-289">Level 289</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-287">Level 287</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Terror Hotel</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">The Snackrooms</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-8">Cave System</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-9">The Suburbs</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">The Infinite City</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-12">Matrix</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-36-1">The Plane</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-40">Roller Rockin' Pizza!</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-43">WaterWorld</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-53">Alone</a> | [<a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-54">Stairwell of Spirals</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-64">The Lurking Darkness</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-66">Swampy Waters</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-71">Void Basement</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-81">Zoological Office</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-92">Crimson Glow</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-94">Motion</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-386">Twisted Halls</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-924">The Nuclear Family</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-293">Alpha</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-286">Level 286</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-serpents-void">The Serpents Void</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-hub">The Hub</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:joke-level-420">Level 420 (Joke)</a> | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/joke-level-fridge">Level Fridge (Joke)</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Rooms</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Traders-Vault">Traders Vault</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-surveillance-room">The Surveillance Room</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Entitles</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3">Smilers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6">Dullers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-15">Wretches</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-31">Camo Crawlers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-32">The Animations</a> | <strong><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-33">THE KING</a></strong> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-48">Aiden</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-54">Scrappers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-63">The Mangled</a>] | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-75">Wranglers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-76">What the hell is this?</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-77">The Dreamweaver</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-85">Paralies</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-167">The Party Hosts</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Objects</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>GOIs</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-B.N.T.G.">The B.N.T.G.</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>POIs</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Tales</th> <td><a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/m-e-g-the-discovery-of-the-wretch">M.E.G.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 05, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been quite a few hours during my long wait for Janice to report back to us. At the time I was just laying on my bed once again, staring at the amazing art piece me and Janice had created. I smiled in joy thinking about all the things we could do together. At that time, I was also bored, so I got up to the small PC system that was hooked up in my room. I connected it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;The M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; Database. Anyone could access the Database, even us. I was curious about what they had to say about &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens&quot;&gt;The Masked Maidens&lt;/a&gt;. From what I&#039;d heard, we didn&#039;t have much people who could commonly connect to The M.E.G. Database. Maybe it was the fact that many of our members could&#039;ve just found a mask recently after finding their way into The Backrooms. Kind of shocks me actually. Well, even now, we do have Maidens creating our own Database. And it will only hold the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I searched, I didn&#039;t find much at all. Seems like the Entries on the Maidens are either classified or purely incomplete, although their Maidens Group Entry does talk about how we use masks and want to stop this &amp;quot;false sense of corruption&amp;quot; as they put it. I chuckled at the fact that they were either hiding the truth, or had no idea. I kind of felt bad in a way if that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was more interesting was that their Entry slot for &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-26&quot;&gt;Object 26&lt;/a&gt; says &amp;quot;Maiden&#039;s Ink&amp;quot; right on the Object&#039;s List, but when clicking on the Entry, it said that the Object slot was under maintenance. I was curious as to why, but I never had the chance to think, as after that, I found my name in the PoI category&amp;#8230; I was shocked; I didn&#039;t understand how or why I was mentioned as a PoI. At the same time, I noticed there was a note on my desked, signed with &amp;quot;Janice&amp;quot;. I wanted to read both things, but before I could even get to it, I was called out by Mackie. She seemed super excited &amp;#8212; she wasn&#039;t wearing her mask, walking in with this goofy grin. It seemed like Janice&#039;s mission was a success. I had to figure that out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Kyra! There you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh hey Mackie! Wh- what&#039;s got you full of smiles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s Janice! She came back with a report and the mission was a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Really!? That&#039;s amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! The experimentation base was successfully raided! They will be stuck looking for resources for a long time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! Well what will we do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, The Madam is has given the order for a celebration! And as a way to thank the strike team and Janice for their brave actions during the successful mission, and you too for finding the data that got us there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So we&#039;re gonna have like.. heh&amp;#8230; a masquerade!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; You jest, but it&#039;s true! We do hold our celebrations as a masquerade type of party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ha! No way! That just makes it better. Very fitting too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; It really is! We would like you to join us, as you did assist the very mission that gave us this moment Kyra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh of course! I&#039;d love to join you guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Follow me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As we walked out of my room, and started to traverse the halls, I could see all the other Maidens laugh and giggle with joy. This was a very important moment for all of us, even just for a little while. We then made it to the main command room. I seen Janice, Amanda and The Madam herself. I even seen Sully having a chat with someone in the distance. We then interrupted The Madam to see what&#039;s up.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;and yes, we will hold a mighty feast! Prepare the bakers! We must&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey Kyra&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! Look at all the Maidens go! Setting up the big party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed they are. And you two are our special guest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;m&amp;#8230; honored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah!.. are you okay Janice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;Okay&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You and Janice will hold a grand speech with us during the beginning of the party, and express yourself and your joy for this special moment!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You have all done wonders for us for the past few weeks and we can&#039;t thank you enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not too enthusiastic&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh- why not&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I am more excited then that. I cannot describe it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ohh! Haha! Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Let&#039;s get this&amp;#8230; show on the road!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright! How can I help out!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well Kyra, you can help the others set up the tables for our feast! We have the bakers forming the most delicious and safe pastries right at this moment and they need the space to place their goods for everyone to enjoy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I suggest getting to it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The Madam claps twice in a quick session. I quickly got to the tables as fast as I can, helping to set them up. As I got there, I was focused on washing the table cloths, as they were fairly stained, probably from the various other celebrations. Then, something came up behind me and startled me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hehah! Haven&#039;t seen you in a quick sec! Well, never mind &amp;#8212; I actually did see you with The Madam as I was on my astonishing journey that is &#039;building tables&#039;. Truly a breathtaking but morally pointless experience! Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ha! Hey Sully!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes yes, I already greeted you but twice is better then none! Heh, so what&#039;s a special party guest like you doing here with us? Heh, I bet you have a special seat reserved just for you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t forget to tell them to give me a special seat too! I&#039;ve always wanted one of those!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll have one for you! You did save us from the guards and all of that after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gah! It was nothing! Just nearly killed me was all! Heha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well we thank you for your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;One day you&#039;re questioning your own existence and the next you&#039;re being awarded for almost not existing! Sounds like a win-win amirite!? Hahaha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, when you put it that way, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I put any word in any way as I myself can go any way! I either make sense or I don&#039;t. Yin and Yang if y&#039;know what I mean! I sure don&#039;t! Heheh!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; That, kind of makes sense. heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hehah! Never thought that was possible. Although I did think it was plausible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, Sully, who are you gonna dance with? I saw you talking to someone over there not too long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh! Maria! Heh&amp;#8230; nah why would she be into this mess?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Pfft! It seemed like she was the one asking you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes, but&amp;#8230; y- y&#039;know I am&amp;#8230; too astonishing for it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh huh. Suuure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No one has ever treated me like I was important before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Then why deny her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Uhh&amp;#8230; heheh&amp;#8230; well being afraid is fun right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Sully&amp;#8230; you&#039;re afraid what she&#039;ll think of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No!&amp;#8230; Maybe&amp;#8230; look it&#039;s an inner battle! I call it nonsense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, remember this. Never be afraid of what makes you special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hehehah! You sound like Janice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh, I guess I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;you know, maybe just for you to shut up about it, I&#039;ll try! Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Awesome! You&#039;ll be great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hopefully I will if I even can be. Never mind, I found my big boy pants! I think I can do it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;m hoping they&#039;ll fit. Heha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hahaha! Good one! I&#039;ll catch you later at the show then! Well, I can&#039;t catch you that would be weird. Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, see you later alligator!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ha! I was never called that before, lemme find my snout!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sully slowly wattles away while making a snout opening and closing with his hands on his face. Unenthusiastically saying &amp;quot;rawr&amp;quot; at the other Maidens.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmph!&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continue scrubbing the tablecloths I quickly turn around and see Janice in the distance. Something felt off. Her behavior just seemed&amp;#8230; bland. I didn&#039;t know what had gotten into her at the time. However, I thought that maybe confessing my love for her during the party would make her feel a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little did I know that this was unfixable&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned back to continue my task at hand. thinking about what to say. How to approach her properly. She told me never to be afraid of what makes me special. So I wouldn&#039;t be afraid to tell her. This was all cut short when Mackie came up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey! What are you doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Just thought I could help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Really, it&#039;s nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Mackie grabs a towel and starts to wash the tables themselves.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to get all the spots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; You got it!&amp;#8230; So, how did you get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! Well, I was actually a member at Camp Amber back in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11&quot;&gt;Level 11&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; The merged Group with The M.E.G.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; it wasn&#039;t fun. They cut our food supply and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;ve heard it came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So did I. Hopefully it did. People need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; They really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Doesn&#039;t help how they&#039;re full of lies though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; yeah. I wouldn&#039;t trust them. They had hurt a lot of people in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I saw some of it through the logs&amp;#8230; the people were forced to be experimented on, and the scientists were forced to work on it. No one wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; Well, how did you find the Maidens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I was actually attacked by Sully while I was on the search for food. Then I found a mask soon after escaping him. I didn&#039;t know what it was. I was scared and I tried to be hesitant at first but&amp;#8230; it just drew me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, those are the effects. Glad you&#039;re here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! Thanks! Sully and Janice found me wandering &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt; soon after. Say, how did you get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; I got into The Backrooms with my brother after falling during a walk in my neighborhood. We found ourselves in Level 0. Luckily for me this was before the change. So we could still see each other. Weeks later&amp;#8230; I think, he found a mask and he wore it all the time. I never found one myself. We eventually got to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt;. He kept finding things for me to survive; it didn&#039;t seem like he needed it. That was until, we found a bunch of M.E.G. personnel. We didn&#039;t know what Base Omega was at the time. He killed one of them, to protect me&amp;#8230; but&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; My brother was killed right in front of me, by those murderers. I took his mask and ran as far as I could&amp;#8230; I ran back into &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&#039;t see from the tears in my eyes. I just sat down and cried for&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t know how long&amp;#8230;. that was until I found The Maidens. The mask lead me there. I&#039;ve been here ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8230; I&#039;m sorry&amp;#8230; Wow&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no need. It&#039;s been three years. I miss him. But at least I found a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel the same way. This feels like home, and I&#039;ll do anything to complete our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#039;s good. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we&#039;ll all stop them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hatred for The M.E.G. grew even more. I wanted to stop these false saviors and put an end to this corruption once and for all. We all did. Well, it was why we were celebrating after all. We stopped one of their largest secret experiment bases. Even if it&#039;s just for a little while. This is a huge moment for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours had passed and it was time for the main event! We had set up a large stage-like area, and on that stage, Me and Janice had our own special reserved seats. And yes, I made sure to get Sully one too. We even had an old gramophone playing classical music. We all went to sit down and The Madam came up to give a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Greetings dear Maidens. Today is a very special day. We had successfully taken out a secret M.E.G. experiment base! We are all here to celebrate the triumphant acts of Janice Haley, Kyra Haywood, Sullivan Vanderlyn and the future downfall of this corruptions growing in the gargantuan factions that once controlled our every move as people. Now, I&#039;d like to introduce our brave heroes to give a speech to all of us here today. Let&#039;s first have Janice Haley be the first to speak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey everyone!&amp;#8230; So uhh&amp;#8230; yeah! We did&amp;#8230; not do- well&amp;#8230; we did many things! I&#039;m&amp;#8230; tired, not? Yeah! Umm, when we got into Base Alph- Omega! And took out all the bad guys and.. uhh- yeah! We got info! And then I&amp;#8230; lead a few people to their dem&amp;#8230; d- destiny! Slithe- getting their way back now at this very&amp;#8230; moment! I- uhh- ahh- I- I&#039;m staged.. stage fright.. tired&amp;#8230; Let&#039;s paaaarty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Janice, slowly walked off the stage and went to this outside balcony area. Few of the Maidens cheered and most stood in bewilderment. I froze, but slowly clapped nervously. What was going on with her? Amanda quickly takes the microphone and speaks.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amanda? What in the world did she say&amp;#8230;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Haha! Uhh, yeah that was certainly&amp;#8230; something! Again she had been through a lot these past few weeks. And she must be very tired as she said! So&amp;#8230; L- let&#039;s bring in Sullivan to&amp;#8230; d- do something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sully walks up to the mic as Amanda moves out of the way back to her seat.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hahaha! Yeah! What a show! No, I mean what! A! Show! I mean I even have my own spot to sit and do absolutely nothing at all! It&#039;s too good! OH! And Janice that was a very inspiring speech! You killed it out there! Like, literally everyone was silent! Not even I could&#039;ve done better! As some of you should not know, Janice and I go way waaay waaaaaaaay back! Heha&amp;#8230; well not that far that would be like&amp;#8230; the creation of the universe or something. Heh, well we&#039;ve been a team for as long as I can remember! I can&#039;t even remember most of it! So that is saying something! It&#039;s a complete mystery to me but we can all get though it together. Now let me sit and think&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;Uhh&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ohhhh right! The reason why I am here! Heha! Yes, indeed I was majestic as the stories go, I flew like a bird raining terror from above to those M.E.G. buckos!&amp;#8230; Well the front isn&#039;t above is it? Well you get the idea! Knocking &#039;em down like bowling pins, it was a home run of a sight!&amp;#8230; If you can even hit bowling balls with a baseball bat&amp;#8230; Y&#039;know, that reminds me how I tried that once; don&#039;t try that at home in case you were getting your socks all in a jiffy about it. So that brings me to my main point&amp;#8230; Birds! They can fly right? Gah! Who am I kidding they swim! No&amp;#8230; wait that was penguins. I mean we do have birds here after all so I have no idea how I could even mess it up so much to get it right. Technically it would be the middle? Heh. Who cares! My main point is that I am absolutely starving for some more destruction of the corruption! Well before my stomach destroys me, excuse me where&#039;s all the grub at?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230; waiting for this to be over first before the feast Sully&amp;#8230; waiting for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wow! I never had food wait for me in my life! Heheha! So why not cut this short and continue for a few hours eyy? Heh&amp;#8230; It&#039;s the perfect way to burn time like the calories after I engulf the delicious pastries. Mmm&amp;#8230; tasty. Okay okay, I know what you&#039;re all thinking &amp;quot;Oh Sully! Tell us some of your astonishingly jaw dropping experiences working for the Masked Maidens&amp;quot; and I will tell you all now that a jester and the self-proclaimed best never gives away their secrets!&amp;#8230; So that is exactly why I&#039;ll tell you my journeys starting with the time where-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As Sully is going on about his nonsense, I notice Janice is still on the balcony, so slowly walk away from the stage and towards her location.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Slither&amp;#8230; Crawl&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Uhh&amp;#8230; Janice? What are you doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmm&amp;#8230;? Ohh, you&amp;#8230; just looking out at nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Staring into space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I didn&#039;t know what was wrong. I went in to try and comfort her. I first asked what happened.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; W- well, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Ohh. Nothing&amp;#8230; just nothing&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You&#039;re lying&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Pfft&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Come on! What&#039;s up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Its like&amp;#8230; everything&amp;#8230; but nothing collapsing on me all at once&amp;#8230; something biting the back of my head&amp;#8230;. have you ever had that feeling? I grew up with it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I- Uhh&amp;#8230; no. But I think I can make you feel better&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; How are you gonna do that&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Because you told me not to be afraid of what makes me special&amp;#8230; and if you have these, events it&#039;s best to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Ehh&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You had done so much for me during my time here. I feel at home. I feel at home because of you&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh. Welcome&amp;#8230; home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well it wouldn&#039;t be without you&amp;#8230; which brings me to my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I reach and grabbed her hand&amp;#8230; it felt so right to me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8230; I love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(There was so many things I wanted to say&amp;#8230; but then&amp;#8230;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Meh&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh- I- Uhh I&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I never&amp;#8230; really cared&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; B- but- wh-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I couldn&#039;t handle it. I tried to run away, but her hand&amp;#8230; it was still holding on, wouldn&#039;t let me go. It was such a strong grip, but I broke free. As I was tearing up, I turn around to see her, she was doing the same. I didn&#039;t put the pieces together but I just thought it was all over. If I only knew&amp;#8230; I ran back to my spot, trying to hide the fact I was crying. Sully was still doing his speech.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I thought it was my mother but then these &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-121&quot;&gt;large yellow frog fellows&lt;/a&gt; came up to me thinking I was the tastiest treat there ever was! Trust me that is far from the truth, but I assure you&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay Sullivan I think that is enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gah! I was just getting to the good bit where I make yellow frog stew! Hahaha!&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay, we would have Kyra give out a speech but I think we had enough&amp;#8230; speeches for today so why not bring out the feast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It is time for the feast in celebration of all our amazing and some certainly strange Maidens!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The Madam then quickly clapped her hands twice as a group of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;Facelings&lt;/a&gt; come out bringing a bunch of baked goods to the table.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s begin shall we!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Right as the party began, two Maidens came into the room as one called out to The Madam in need of assistance.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-1 &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Madam! We have a Maiden in need of medical attention!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Could it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh my&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;H- heelp&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Who could&#039;ve done such a thing!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;He&#039;s burnt with electricity marks, it was an Entity attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-1 &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That is not all, he said to me over and over that it was a set-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I was frozen in fear from what the Maiden said)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-1 &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;He claims the captain lead them to a trap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-2 &amp;quot;Volto&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hurry! He needs help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wh- what!? Someone get this man help and figure this out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Janice Haley! Get right here this instant!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(She slowly walked towards the middle of the room. The fact that a man is barely alive close by and burnt never even phased her.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&amp;#8230; Madam&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Did you do this to one of our OWN kind!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is outrageous! Would this mean you are The M.E.G. Spy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;Yes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ohhhhhhhh snap!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You had killed the entire strike team! That is not something you can get away with!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I always had an inkling of suspicion, but I never expected it to be true, and this does not help your case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Kyra! Does this mean you are also a spy!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(All the other Maidens turn their heads towards me. Filed with anger and sadness.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; N- no! No I&#039;d never!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Madam!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Kyra was never a part of this. I can confirm she is telling the truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;How do we know we could trust you hmm?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230; very well. Kyra will be interrogated soon after. Once she&amp;#8230; get&#039;s a hold of herself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Everyone can see how I was. Full of tears, I was embarrassed, but I didn&#039;t care anymore.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As for you Janice&amp;#8230; you will be banned from ever being within a Maidens station again! We will give you this last chance to live. Leave while you can. I am disgusted from the horrors and misery you had brought on our strike team and your faction&#039;s corruption in general. What do you have to say for yourself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pardon me Madam, I had enough of this, she will not say anythin-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amanda Wright, you may only speak when I deem it necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;So you&#039;re just going let her run free?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why would we keep her here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Did you not remember my plans for traitors? I was rambling on about it for ages!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed I have, I had put it down on the list with your behaviors about the situation at hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of course, taking notes as always.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It was for security reasons! We cannot have-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As The Madam and Amanda were having an argument, Janice walked out of the room, and assumingly the entirety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Level 67&lt;/a&gt; slowly.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And that is why&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pfft, I&#039;m done with this. This argument is pointless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amanda sits back down and tilts her head back and took a deep breath to release stress.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Umm&amp;#8230; wh- why didn&#039;t we just lock her up for more M.E.G. information?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230; She is tough, she will never speak to us no matter what happens. And we are not monsters like the corruption to kill people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shut&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hmm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. I ran to my room, as I was running I could see all the other Maidens stare at me as I was crying. I didn&#039;t want anything to do with this, I didn&#039;t want nothing. I just wanted to be alone. Alone like I always was. Sobbing in my bed for hours and hours. Thinking about that one moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was just there, her grip was so tight but her words were so hurtful. I didn&#039;t understand it. I didn&#039;t want to. I was so sad I could barely breathe. Everything I tried to build up, everything I thought I had just collapsed all in one moment&amp;#8230; or may I never had anything at all&amp;#8230; I didn&#039;t know anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just didn&#039;t know why. Why put me through all of this? Why treat me as if I was important to say you never cared? For what reason&amp;#8230;? I never knew at the time&amp;#8230; there was just one more thing&amp;#8230; her skin was&amp;#8230; more flaky&amp;#8230; I can&#039;t describe it. It felt older and dry. And her arm&amp;#8230; there was this shape in her arm&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:entity-85&quot;&gt;It looked like a snake...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>June 05, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>It had been quite a few hours during my long wait for Janice to report back to us. At the time I was just laying on my bed once again, staring at the amazing art piece me and Janice had created. I smiled in joy thinking about all the things we could do together. At that time, I was also bored, so I got up to the small PC system that was hooked up in my room. I connected it to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> Database. Anyone could access the Database, even us. I was curious about what they had to say about <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-masked-maidens">The Masked Maidens</a>. From what I'd heard, we didn't have much people who could commonly connect to The M.E.G. Database. Maybe it was the fact that many of our members could've just found a mask recently after finding their way into The Backrooms. Kind of shocks me actually. Well, even now, we do have Maidens creating our own Database. And it will only hold the truth.</p> <p>Well, as I searched, I didn't find much at all. Seems like the Entries on the Maidens are either classified or purely incomplete, although their Maidens Group Entry does talk about how we use masks and want to stop this &quot;false sense of corruption&quot; as they put it. I chuckled at the fact that they were either hiding the truth, or had no idea. I kind of felt bad in a way if that was the case.</p> <p>What was more interesting was that their Entry slot for <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-26">Object 26</a> says &quot;Maiden's Ink&quot; right on the Object's List, but when clicking on the Entry, it said that the Object slot was under maintenance. I was curious as to why, but I never had the chance to think, as after that, I found my name in the PoI category&#8230; I was shocked; I didn't understand how or why I was mentioned as a PoI. At the same time, I noticed there was a note on my desked, signed with &quot;Janice&quot;. I wanted to read both things, but before I could even get to it, I was called out by Mackie. She seemed super excited &#8212; she wasn't wearing her mask, walking in with this goofy grin. It seemed like Janice's mission was a success. I had to figure that out later.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Kyra! There you are!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh hey Mackie! Wh- what's got you full of smiles?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> It's Janice! She came back with a report and the mission was a success!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Really!? That's amazing!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Yeah! The experimentation base was successfully raided! They will be stuck looking for resources for a long time!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wow! Well what will we do now?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Well, The Madam is has given the order for a celebration! And as a way to thank the strike team and Janice for their brave actions during the successful mission, and you too for finding the data that got us there!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So we're gonna have like.. heh&#8230; a masquerade!?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> You jest, but it's true! We do hold our celebrations as a masquerade type of party.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ha! No way! That just makes it better. Very fitting too!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> It really is! We would like you to join us, as you did assist the very mission that gave us this moment Kyra.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh of course! I'd love to join you guys!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Follow me.</p> <p><em>(As we walked out of my room, and started to traverse the halls, I could see all the other Maidens laugh and giggle with joy. This was a very important moment for all of us, even just for a little while. We then made it to the main command room. I seen Janice, Amanda and The Madam herself. I even seen Sully having a chat with someone in the distance. We then interrupted The Madam to see what's up.)</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>&#8230;and yes, we will hold a mighty feast! Prepare the bakers! We must&#8212;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Hey Kyra&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wow! Look at all the Maidens go! Setting up the big party.</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Indeed they are. And you two are our special guest.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I'm&#8230; honored.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah!.. are you okay Janice?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;Okay&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>You and Janice will hold a grand speech with us during the beginning of the party, and express yourself and your joy for this special moment!</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>You have all done wonders for us for the past few weeks and we can't thank you enough.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I am not too enthusiastic&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wh- why not&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I am more excited then that. I cannot describe it!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ohh! Haha! Yeah!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Let's get this&#8230; show on the road!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Alright! How can I help out!?</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Well Kyra, you can help the others set up the tables for our feast! We have the bakers forming the most delicious and safe pastries right at this moment and they need the space to place their goods for everyone to enjoy!</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>I suggest getting to it!</em></p> <p><em>(The Madam claps twice in a quick session. I quickly got to the tables as fast as I can, helping to set them up. As I got there, I was focused on washing the table cloths, as they were fairly stained, probably from the various other celebrations. Then, something came up behind me and startled me.)</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hehah! Haven't seen you in a quick sec! Well, never mind &#8212; I actually did see you with The Madam as I was on my astonishing journey that is 'building tables'. Truly a breathtaking but morally pointless experience! Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ha! Hey Sully!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Yes yes, I already greeted you but twice is better then none! Heh, so what's a special party guest like you doing here with us? Heh, I bet you have a special seat reserved just for you!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Heh!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Don't forget to tell them to give me a special seat too! I've always wanted one of those!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh I'm sure they'll have one for you! You did save us from the guards and all of that after all!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Gah! It was nothing! Just nearly killed me was all! Heha!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well we thank you for your efforts.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>One day you're questioning your own existence and the next you're being awarded for almost not existing! Sounds like a win-win amirite!? Hahaha!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, when you put it that way, I guess?</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>I put any word in any way as I myself can go any way! I either make sense or I don't. Yin and Yang if y'know what I mean! I sure don't! Heheh!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> That, kind of makes sense. heh.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hehah! Never thought that was possible. Although I did think it was plausible!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, Sully, who are you gonna dance with? I saw you talking to someone over there not too long ago.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Oh! Maria! Heh&#8230; nah why would she be into this mess?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Pfft! It seemed like she was the one asking you.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Yes, but&#8230; y- y'know I am&#8230; too astonishing for it!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Uh huh. Suuure!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>No one has ever treated me like I was important before.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Then why deny her?</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Uhh&#8230; heheh&#8230; well being afraid is fun right?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Sully&#8230; you're afraid what she'll think of you?</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>No!&#8230; Maybe&#8230; look it's an inner battle! I call it nonsense.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, remember this. Never be afraid of what makes you special.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hehehah! You sound like Janice!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Heh, I guess I did.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>you know, maybe just for you to shut up about it, I'll try! Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Awesome! You'll be great!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hopefully I will if I even can be. Never mind, I found my big boy pants! I think I can do it!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I'm hoping they'll fit. Heha!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hahaha! Good one! I'll catch you later at the show then! Well, I can't catch you that would be weird. Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, see you later alligator!</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Ha! I was never called that before, lemme find my snout!</em></p> <p><em>(Sully slowly wattles away while making a snout opening and closing with his hands on his face. Unenthusiastically saying &quot;rawr&quot; at the other Maidens.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Hmph!&#8230;</p> </div> <hr /> <p>As I continue scrubbing the tablecloths I quickly turn around and see Janice in the distance. Something felt off. Her behavior just seemed&#8230; bland. I didn't know what had gotten into her at the time. However, I thought that maybe confessing my love for her during the party would make her feel a lot better.</p> <p><strong>Little did I know that this was unfixable&#8230;</strong></p> <p>I turned back to continue my task at hand. thinking about what to say. How to approach her properly. She told me never to be afraid of what makes me special. So I wouldn't be afraid to tell her. This was all cut short when Mackie came up to me.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Hello again!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Hey! What are you doing here?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Just thought I could help out.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Huh, thanks!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Really, it's nothing!</p> <p><em>(Mackie grabs a towel and starts to wash the tables themselves.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Be sure to get all the spots!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> You got it!&#8230; So, how did you get here?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh! Well, I was actually a member at Camp Amber back in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">Level 11</a>!</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> The merged Group with The M.E.G.?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah&#8230; it wasn't fun. They cut our food supply and everything.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> I've heard it came back.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So did I. Hopefully it did. People need it.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> They really do.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Doesn't help how they're full of lies though.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Well&#8230; yeah. I wouldn't trust them. They had hurt a lot of people in secret.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I saw some of it through the logs&#8230; the people were forced to be experimented on, and the scientists were forced to work on it. No one wanted to be there.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Yeah&#8230; Well, how did you find the Maidens?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, I was actually attacked by Sully while I was on the search for food. Then I found a mask soon after escaping him. I didn't know what it was. I was scared and I tried to be hesitant at first but&#8230; it just drew me in.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Yeah, those are the effects. Glad you're here!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah! Thanks! Sully and Janice found me wandering <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a> soon after. Say, how did you get here?</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> Well&#8230; I got into The Backrooms with my brother after falling during a walk in my neighborhood. We found ourselves in Level 0. Luckily for me this was before the change. So we could still see each other. Weeks later&#8230; I think, he found a mask and he wore it all the time. I never found one myself. We eventually got to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a>. He kept finding things for me to survive; it didn't seem like he needed it. That was until, we found a bunch of M.E.G. personnel. We didn't know what Base Omega was at the time. He killed one of them, to protect me&#8230; but&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> My brother was killed right in front of me, by those murderers. I took his mask and ran as far as I could&#8230; I ran back into <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a>. I couldn't see from the tears in my eyes. I just sat down and cried for&#8230; I don't know how long&#8230;. that was until I found The Maidens. The mask lead me there. I've been here ever since.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I&#8230; I'm sorry&#8230; Wow&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> No, no need. It's been three years. I miss him. But at least I found a home.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I feel the same way. This feels like home, and I'll do anything to complete our mission.</p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> That's good. Thank you.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah, we'll all stop them together.</p> </div> <hr /> <p>My hatred for The M.E.G. grew even more. I wanted to stop these false saviors and put an end to this corruption once and for all. We all did. Well, it was why we were celebrating after all. We stopped one of their largest secret experiment bases. Even if it's just for a little while. This is a huge moment for us.</p> <p>A few hours had passed and it was time for the main event! We had set up a large stage-like area, and on that stage, Me and Janice had our own special reserved seats. And yes, I made sure to get Sully one too. We even had an old gramophone playing classical music. We all went to sit down and The Madam came up to give a speech.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Greetings dear Maidens. Today is a very special day. We had successfully taken out a secret M.E.G. experiment base! We are all here to celebrate the triumphant acts of Janice Haley, Kyra Haywood, Sullivan Vanderlyn and the future downfall of this corruptions growing in the gargantuan factions that once controlled our every move as people. Now, I'd like to introduce our brave heroes to give a speech to all of us here today. Let's first have Janice Haley be the first to speak.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Hey everyone!&#8230; So uhh&#8230; yeah! We did&#8230; not do- well&#8230; we did many things! I'm&#8230; tired, not? Yeah! Umm, when we got into Base Alph- Omega! And took out all the bad guys and.. uhh- yeah! We got info! And then I&#8230; lead a few people to their dem&#8230; d- destiny! Slithe- getting their way back now at this very&#8230; moment! I- uhh- ahh- I- I'm staged.. stage fright.. tired&#8230; Let's paaaarty!</p> <p><em>(Janice, slowly walked off the stage and went to this outside balcony area. Few of the Maidens cheered and most stood in bewilderment. I froze, but slowly clapped nervously. What was going on with her? Amanda quickly takes the microphone and speaks.)</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Amanda? What in the world did she say&#8230;?</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Haha! Uhh, yeah that was certainly&#8230; something! Again she had been through a lot these past few weeks. And she must be very tired as she said! So&#8230; L- let's bring in Sullivan to&#8230; d- do something.</em></p> <p><em>(Sully walks up to the mic as Amanda moves out of the way back to her seat.)</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Hahaha! Yeah! What a show! No, I mean what! A! Show! I mean I even have my own spot to sit and do absolutely nothing at all! It's too good! OH! And Janice that was a very inspiring speech! You killed it out there! Like, literally everyone was silent! Not even I could've done better! As some of you should not know, Janice and I go way waaay waaaaaaaay back! Heha&#8230; well not that far that would be like&#8230; the creation of the universe or something. Heh, well we've been a team for as long as I can remember! I can't even remember most of it! So that is saying something! It's a complete mystery to me but we can all get though it together. Now let me sit and think&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>&#8230;Uhh&#8212;</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Ohhhh right! The reason why I am here! Heha! Yes, indeed I was majestic as the stories go, I flew like a bird raining terror from above to those M.E.G. buckos!&#8230; Well the front isn't above is it? Well you get the idea! Knocking 'em down like bowling pins, it was a home run of a sight!&#8230; If you can even hit bowling balls with a baseball bat&#8230; Y'know, that reminds me how I tried that once; don't try that at home in case you were getting your socks all in a jiffy about it. So that brings me to my main point&#8230; Birds! They can fly right? Gah! Who am I kidding they swim! No&#8230; wait that was penguins. I mean we do have birds here after all so I have no idea how I could even mess it up so much to get it right. Technically it would be the middle? Heh. Who cares! My main point is that I am absolutely starving for some more destruction of the corruption! Well before my stomach destroys me, excuse me where's all the grub at?</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Sigh&#8230; waiting for this to be over first before the feast Sully&#8230; waiting for you.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Wow! I never had food wait for me in my life! Heheha! So why not cut this short and continue for a few hours eyy? Heh&#8230; It's the perfect way to burn time like the calories after I engulf the delicious pastries. Mmm&#8230; tasty. Okay okay, I know what you're all thinking &quot;Oh Sully! Tell us some of your astonishingly jaw dropping experiences working for the Masked Maidens&quot; and I will tell you all now that a jester and the self-proclaimed best never gives away their secrets!&#8230; So that is exactly why I'll tell you my journeys starting with the time where-</em></p> <p><em>(As Sully is going on about his nonsense, I notice Janice is still on the balcony, so slowly walk away from the stage and towards her location.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Slither&#8230; Crawl&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Uhh&#8230; Janice? What are you doing.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Hmm&#8230;? Ohh, you&#8230; just looking out at nothing.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Staring into space?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><em>(I didn't know what was wrong. I went in to try and comfort her. I first asked what happened.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> W- well, what happened?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Ohh. Nothing&#8230; just nothing&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Nothing&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You're lying&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Pfft&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Come on! What's up?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Its like&#8230; everything&#8230; but nothing collapsing on me all at once&#8230; something biting the back of my head&#8230;. have you ever had that feeling? I grew up with it&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I- Uhh&#8230; no. But I think I can make you feel better&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> How are you gonna do that&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Because you told me not to be afraid of what makes me special&#8230; and if you have these, events it's best to tell me.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Ehh&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You had done so much for me during my time here. I feel at home. I feel at home because of you&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Huh. Welcome&#8230; home?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well it wouldn't be without you&#8230; which brings me to my point.</p> <p><em>(I reach and grabbed her hand&#8230; it felt so right to me.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I&#8230; I love you.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><em>(There was so many things I wanted to say&#8230; but then&#8230;)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Meh&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wh- I- Uhh I&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I never&#8230; really cared&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> B- but- wh-</p> <p><em>(I couldn't handle it. I tried to run away, but her hand&#8230; it was still holding on, wouldn't let me go. It was such a strong grip, but I broke free.

If I only knew&#8230; I ran back to my spot, trying to hide the fact I was crying. Sully was still doing his speech.)</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>I thought it was my mother but then these <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-121">large yellow frog fellows</a> came up to me thinking I was the tastiest treat there ever was!

I was just getting to the good bit where I make yellow frog stew! Hahaha!&#8212;</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Okay, we would have Kyra give out a speech but I think we had enough&#8230; speeches for today so why not bring out the feast!</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>It is time for the feast in celebration of all our amazing and some certainly strange Maidens!</em></p> <p><em>(The Madam then quickly clapped her hands twice as a group of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9">Facelings</a> come out bringing a bunch of baked goods to the table.)</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Let's begin shall we!?</em></p> <p><em>(Right as the party began, two Maidens came into the room as one called out to The Madam in need of assistance.</em>)</p> <p><strong>MM Member-1 &quot;Bauta&quot;:</strong> <em>Madam!

Alone like I always was. Sobbing in my bed for hours and hours. Thinking about that one moment.</p> <p>She was just there, her grip was so tight but her words were so hurtful. I didn't understand it. I didn't want to. I was so sad I could barely breathe.

I never knew at the time&#8230; there was just one more thing&#8230; her skin was&#8230; more flaky&#8230; I can't describe it. It felt older and dry.

&lt;p&gt;The highest fidelity image of Level 10.1 to date, taken 2/14/2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 10.1 consists entirely of a manmade lake, named Corpse Lake, located in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10&quot;&gt;Level 10&lt;/a&gt;. It is located approximately twenty miles, or forty kilometers, from the nearest inhabited settlement: Malt Town. Despite being an easily accessible location, and theoretically still a constituent of the Level 10 plane, this area was given the appellation of &amp;quot;Sub-section&amp;quot; in hopes of highlighting the erratic and highly perilous properties of this particular region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lake is radioactive, toxic, and carnivorous. It was created out of extensive failed attempts at neutralizing instances of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Object 24&lt;/a&gt; through extreme heat. Attempting to destroy an instance of Object 24 through melting it only creates a highly dangerous, semi-sentient chemical solution that seeks out the nearest living animal, including humans, and proceeds to consume it through liquidation. Due to the extremely perilous nature of this mixture, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;the M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; have declared Level 10.1 to be the designated location to dump said liquid in hopes of nullifying its detrimental effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radiation level within one square mile of the lake&#039;s surface is about 700 roentgens per hour, or approximately 7&amp;#160;Sv/hr. For comparison, the radiation level of the reactor hall of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is 34&amp;#160;Sv/hr and can kill a human being in less than ten to twenty minutes. Standing adjacent to Corpse Lake for more than an hour is fatal. Because of the M.E.G.&#039;s lack of supply of radioactive protective gear, &lt;strong&gt;nobody, including M.E.G. personnel, is allowed to travel within ten square miles, or approximately 26 square kilometers, without express permission from the Overseers.&lt;/strong&gt; Because of the extreme toxicity of this environment, those who enter the ten mile radius, now designated as the Corpse Lake Exclusion Zone, will receive no further help or contact from any M.E.G. personnel and will be henceforth be considered deceased. From the moment one enters the Corpse Lake Exclusion Zone, one&#039;s skin and clothes will be too contaminated for the M.E.G. to be able to offer assistance of any kind. Over the course of nine months, studies have shown that the radiation level of Corpse Lake has been gradually increasing since the initial creation incident, which displayed a large influx of the substance and thus contributed to such a high number. It is unknown what the cause of it is, and if or when this increase in radiation will effect nearby settlements such as Malt Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Biotic and Abiotic Properties:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what exactly makes Corpse Lake so radioactive. It is assumed to be one of the repercussions of trying to eliminate Object 24 instances. While inanimate, these masks conscientiously resist being destroyed, and thus it can be assumed that both the constant radiation emitted and the fluid&#039;s aggressive, hostile nature can be accredited to a sort of defensive mechanism. Debate is still ongoing as to whether or not Object 24, and by extension the fluid remains of it, can be truly considered &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot;. From previous reports, the lake appears to retain some sort of sentience and memory, behaving especially threatening towards personnel that were directly involved in the masks&#039; destruction. Quite a number of casualties have occurred since this solution&#039;s accidental creation, and the grim reminders of them still lie within it to this day. At first, the mixture was pitch black in color, but has since turned a murky crimson after the blood of several fallen operatives was absorbed through exsanguination. At the time of writing, a year has passed without any similar incidents occurring. The blood has yet to dissolve, and no victims have been reported since August 12th, 2021. This leads to the conclusion that either the solution is not alive, or it can sustain itself without ingesting other living beings or digesting the blood that still sits on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-left&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/46029305242_4c91958431_b.png&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what exactly causes the radiation that the solution emits. It is considered too dangerous, and the M.E.G. is too ill-equipped in terms of protective gear to safely analyze the substance. As such, the elemental composition of the liquid is entirely unknown. When the liquid was created, several small portions of it were contained in petri dishes and analyzed before the M.E.G. operatives died of radiation positioning. The information gathered by these valiant people comprises the majority of what we know now about the mystery liquid that makes up sub-section 10.1, however little that is. Included is a picture of a petri dish containing the liquid taken using ultraviolet imaging. The liquid appears to contain a network of strange pathways that only emit ultraviolet light and no other wavelength. Invisible to the naked eye, it seems as if the liquid created by the masks contains several &amp;quot;veins&amp;quot; of some manner. The M.E.G. hypothesizes that these veins are what carry nutrients gained by the liquid to the center. It has been noted that in the exact center of whatever shape the liquid takes, there is a large black area that cannot be penetrated with any form of light. This makes the area darker than the darkest visible shade known to man, Vantablack. It is unknown what the exact purpose of this black spot is, but its apparent function can be likened to that of a heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following description contains graphic depictions of the way in which the substance of Level 10.1 causes the untimely and gruesome demises of wanderers who come in unprotected contact with it. While it is encouraged that one reads the article in whole in order to fully understand the dangers of both this Sub-section and this substance, the details listed below are potentially discomforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiation Poisoning:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon coming in contact with radiation from the substance of Level 10.1, wanderers will develop radiation poisoning. This is constant no matter how much radiation wanderers are exposed to, whether it be a lethal dosage or what would normally be non-harmful. This makes exposure to the substance incredibly dangerous, as coming in contact with even the smallest amount of radiation, even though a protective suit, spells guaranteed death within the next hour. Radiation levels have been measured to be deadly as little as one centimeter inside the Exclusion Zone, and yet the area outside of it remains completely radiation-free (except for one notable exception, described in an attached report.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderers who become afflicted with radiation sickness from Level 10.1 develop all the major symptoms of it within thirty minutes. Observation has proven that all wanderers will go through three distinct stages within an hour of contamination before eventually passing away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footerbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white&quot;&gt;Stage One:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;footerspan&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;Within 10 minutes of contamination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerflavor&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderers begin to experience strong nausea and dizziness, with occasional vomiting. Headaches have been reported, and mild fevers begin to develop. Sporadic boils begin to appear on wanderers&#039; skin. Many claim that they have felt fatigued, and there have been several cases of stomachaches and cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-21399730071059237815&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;html-block-iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white&quot;&gt;Stage Two:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;footerspan&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;Within 30 minutes of contamination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerflavor&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanderers experience a large and grotesque outbreak of boils covering their entire body. Many of them expand and burst, exposing blood to the open environment. Vomiting becomes extreme and violent, with occasional blood leakage. Stomachaches become nearly unbearable, causing wanderers to keel over in pain. Disorientation inundates many wanderers at this stage, causing them to lose consciousness. Studies have shown that many wanderers at this stage start to bleed internally, and their stomach acid begins to destroy the protective coating in the stomach and eat through their body from the inside by unknown means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-6178871491540796113&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;html-block-iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white&quot;&gt;Stage Three:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;footerspan&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;Within 60 minutes of contamination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerflavor&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stage is the most gruesome and dangerous stage of the substance-induced radiation poisoning. Before a total of 60 minutes has elapsed since coming in contact with the radiation, all the blood within wanderers&#039; body will converge and congeal in the center of their body. This motion will tear through a majority of the wanderers&#039; vital organs and cause them to die through hemorrhaging. Once the wanderer is deceased, the substance will then burst forth from the victim&#039;s stomach and take on all the properties of the substance in the Corpse Lake. It will be just as radioactive, just as hostile, and just as dangerous. This has the potential for a domino effect of infection after infection if proper isolation and quarantining methods are not taken. Because the bodies of dead victims produce new amounts of this substance, those who develop radiation poisoning are to be considered dead and to be isolated from any other potential victims, regardless of whether or not they are wearing protective suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical Contact and Blood Draining:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other primary way in which the substance, and by extension, Level 10.1, kills its prey is through direct physical contact with animal cells of any kind. Upon coming into contact with any part of a human&#039;s body, most likely the skin, the substance will begin to latch on and instantaneously solidify into a semi-solid of the same consistency and stickiness of a spider&#039;s web or coagulated glue. The substance will then begin to drain the victim&#039;s blood through the ultraviolet veins present in all parts of its amorphous figure. Nothing but the blood will be removed from the victim&#039;s body, and when every trace of it down to the atomic level is absorbed, the substance will automatically reverse its coagulation, return to a more liquid form, and retract from the cadaver, leaving naught but the wrinkled remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an unknown reason, this process will never happen to plant cells of any kind. As such, grass and other plants can freely grow on the banks of the lake. Algae species and other adjacent lifeforms, such as trichodesmium, have been observed to flourish in the lake. Experiments have been conducted in the past to sample specimens that survive in this otherwise perilous environment, and are logged below the list of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Archived Official M.E.G. Notice, Distributed to the Citizens of Malt Town, April 4th, 2021:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white&quot;&gt;NOTICE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;footerspan&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;April 4th, 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footerflavor&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regarding Level 10.1:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location for 10.1 was chosen due to the original depression containing an entrance to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-924&quot;&gt;an undocumented level&lt;/a&gt;. The reason this level remains undocumented is because there are no known entrances, and all who have previously entered have never been heard from afterwards. It was thought that the substance could be disposed of by hopefully pouring it into the depression to be transported to this level, but this has not been the case. Instead, it appears that Corpse Lake has been able to absorb a liquid coming &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the level (presumably water) to increase its volume dramatically. Corpse Lake continues to grow in volume to this day, albeit at a very slow rate. Regardless, citizens of Malt Town are to kept on high alert at all times and to prepare for possible evacuations at a moment&#039;s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The M.E.G. has found it necessary to document all casualties related to Level 10.1, as studying the cause of death and recognizing patterns is of utmost importance. Furthermore, the tragic nature of this location asks for us to commemorate those who valiantly gave their lives in the hope that their discoveries may aid those in the future, as well as the misfortune of those unlucky enough to stumble into the Exclusion Zone without any prior knowledge of it. The M.E.G. hopes that by publishing this information, the number of accidental deaths due to radiation poisoning begins to decline henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a notice to all wanderers and M.E.G. Operatives alike. As of August 10th, 2021, nobody is to cross the barbed wire fencing without express permission from the Overseers and proper protective gear. Barbed wire fencing, as well as warning signs, have been installed around the perimeter. Crossing the boundary without proper and functioning high-caliber radioactive protective gear will result in certain death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time of dumping, the total volume of the substance was approximately two cubic meters (70 cubic feet). However, while the radiation levels went down, the total volume of the substance dramatically increased to 0.8 cubic miles (3.33 cubic kilometers). This increase is theorized to be the result of several endemic entities, such as Gluffs, or undocumented wanderers coming in contact with what is now called Corpse Lake. However, it is possible the increase is due to an influx of water from the original unknown level whose entrance Level 10.1 now covers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;whiteboxnomargin&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;ATTENTION: Unusually high winds have been detected around the Malt Town area, in addition to high levels of radiation. This radiation is suspected to come from Level 10.1, which lies approximately 20 miles (40 kilometers) from Malt Town. This radiation is especially dangerous because it will inflict lethal radiation poisoning on any human or animal that is exposed to even a single particle of it. All inhabitants of Malt Town are to evacuate immediately and head to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-b-n-t-g&quot;&gt;the-b-n-t-g&lt;/a&gt; Level 10 Resource Station. It is unknown exactly how long this radiation will last, so be prepared to it to last indefinitely. Grab all precious belongings and do not waste a second, for it could be the difference between life and death. Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;ATTENTION: After a detailed survey of the environment, radiation levels in Malt Town are still unsafe for habitation. Civilians who are debating whether or not they should return are strongly urged to stay in the B.N.T.G. Level 10 Resource Station. The radiation level is slowly declining, but Malt Town must be cleared of all residual substance particles before it is hospitable to habilitation. For now, stay put and stay safe, everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Study of Recovered Aquatic Plant Specimen from Level 10.1:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine the effect of the substance of Level 10.1 on nearby plant life, a total of 48 distinct samples were collected from Level 10.1 of several aquatic plants, including xanthophytes (yellow-green algae), trichodesmium, and chlorophyta (green algae). In addition to coloration and composition comparisons to control groups of these specimen, collected at the Fuchsia Embassy in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-121&quot;&gt;Level 121&lt;/a&gt;, radioactivity levels were also carefully monitored over the course of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from several trials show that microscopic particles of the Level 10.1 substance are present within each collected specimen from Corpse Lake, and behave with just as much intensity as a macroscopic amount of it. It appears that radiation level, along with volume, increases dramatically in proportion to the amount of water present in the nearby environment. This is consistent throughout all species of recovered aquatic life. Despite exhibiting radiation levels up to 456 roentgens/h, which is enough to cause detrimental effects, including mortality, on plant life, there was not a single instance recorded of that being the case. The results of this study suggest that only animal cells, and not plant cells, are susceptible to the harmful effects of the Level 10.1 substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Case Study 1: Xanthophyte (Yellow-green algae)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/8732382368_63519f1831.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irradiated xanthophyte sample. Note the presence of lighter flecks, which are substance particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the irradiated xanthophyte sample and the imported control sample were placed in 100mm petri dishes containing 15ml of water. Both petri dish samples were held under two 40-watt fluorescent tubes for a total of three consecutive days and were closely monitored. Radiation levels and volume of substance were documented and graphed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all other trials, the control group&#039;s petri dish was contaminated as a result of unexpectedly intense radiation emitted from the irradiated algae after substance expansion. Both samples capped at 563.5 roentgens/h, which should have proven lethal to both algae specimens. However, both algae continued to grow after this point unbridled by this complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Case Study 2: Trichodesmium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/Thing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/level-10-1/Thing/medium.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irradiated trichodesmium sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the results of the first set of trials, the petri dishes were replaced with radiation-resistant petri dishes in order to prevent contamination of the control group. In addition, data was only collected during a 24-hour period in which the data was recorded remotely instead of by hand, due to the high amount of radioactive fallout present at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radiation protection of the petri dishes proved unsuccessful, as both the substance volume and radiation level increased much faster than in the previous experiment. Information and data collection were limited by the unsafe conditions inside the testing site, and thus accuracy and precision of data were lessened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No experiments were conducted on chlorophyta. The chlorophyta specimen take from Corpse Lake was instead returned due to unsafe conditions that heavily endangered&lt;br /&gt;
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protective equipment isnt enough. it somehow got in our suits, and were already fee ling the symptoms of the radiation poisonbing. We&#039;re droppping the formalities here. We can&#039;t escape, because we&#039;ll just contaminate others. I thought I was prepared to die goin g into this&amp;#8230; but we&#039;re all realizing we&#039;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be our last message to the world. Inst ead of trying to run and making the situation worse, we&#039;re choosing to accept our fattes and put every last bit of informmation we can spossibly gather in our dying moments here so that people in the future can make use of it. That&#039;s what this is for really. Especially the poor citizens of Malt Town.. We&#039;re not going to be like those two wan derers who contaminated people in that village before they died two mont hs ago. Subi isialterady dead. With our dying breath, we .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-19&quot;&gt;Entity 19 - &amp;quot;The Disease&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and the Level 10.1 Substance exhibit a similar level of danger and to some extent, behavior. Experiments and comparisons were conducted between the two in order to elucidate any possible relations they might have, as well as to discover potentially new information about the origin, structure, and function of the Level 10.1 Substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Structure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/27257707934_7d54c13a77_b.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entity 19 sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/4966621857_e3952d2563_b.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:250px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microscopic study reveals that the structures of Entity 19 and the Level 10.1 substance are similar but functionally different. The substance of Level 10.1 is not comprised of multiple individual bacteria like Entity 19, but is instead a chemical mixture of several radioactive molecules with suspended ultraviolet veins in its semi-gelatinous volume. It has been determined that these veins vary in structure. Some are made of a single layer of endothelial cells and can be likened to human capillaries, while others are made of connective tissue and can be likened to human superficial veins. Therefore, Entity 19 and the substance of Level 10.1 are fundamentally unique and are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substance of Level 10.1 is also not a bacterium, despite its pathogenic effect. Both Entity 19 and the substance were contained in sterile containers and introduced to 1 μL&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-389271-2&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of human blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entity 19 immediately started producing liminatidin, which started accelerating primary coagulation, creating platelet clusters. In comparison, instead of affecting haemostasis, the substance of Level 10.1 used its veins to absorb and carry red blood cells throughout its venous system. A majority of the red blood cells, and in addition, its nutrients, were ferried through the substance into the black area at its center. The presence of blood in the veins is what gives the substance its signature crimson coloration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Entity 19 and the substance expanded rather quickly, but the substance expanded at a much greater rate than Entity 19. In a matter of hours, the substance had converted the 1 μL of blood into approximately 5 extra milliliters of volume, bring its total volume to 6 milliliters. For comparison, Entity 19 experienced an increase of only 1 ml of volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Entity 19 and the substance of Level 10.1 are too different to be related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additional Notes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While consuming the 1 μL of blood, the substance of Level 10.1 emitted a sound inaudible to human ears at approximately 30 PHz&lt;sup class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnoteref-389271-3&quot; href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; class=&quot;footnoteref&quot;  &gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which was proportionally reconstructed at a frequency humans can hear. A copy of the audio file is provided below for viewing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Observations of an Irradiated Wanderer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amelie Heroux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 8/12/2021, a Wanderer by the name of Amelie Heroux was found at the boundary of the Exclusion Zone during a routine checkup by M.E.G. operatives. A makeshift experiment was then staged, as she displayed acute signs of the radiation sickness. She was immediately taken into isolation in a semi-conscious state. After being told that she would perish in less than an hour, she consented to have her final moments observed and recorded for the sake of future civilians&#039; safety. However, she personally requested that her submitted picture be censored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recording Transcript:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt; Begin recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; Recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; So, how much time do I have left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[At this point, it has been fifteen minutes since Heroux was exposed to radiation, and she is at the first stage of radiation poisoning.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; At most, forty-five minutes, I&#039;m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Why&amp;#8230; [[coughs]] that is not nearly as much time as I would have hoped. There simply isn&#039;t enough time to think of what to say. And an old lady like me should have been prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Silence passes.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you just going to sit there, taking your notes in those&amp;#8230; suits? It feels so&amp;#8230; inhuman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt; We cannot touch you for safety reasons, Mrs. Heroux. I&#039;m deeply sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, I know that very well. I&#039;m not asking you to hold my hand. But you know as well as I do what&#039;s going to happen to me. It&#039;s not going to be pretty &amp;#8212; I feel it churning about in my stomach. I can&#039;t imagine what it&#039;ll look like when it crawls out. It&#039;s a horrible way to die. Not because my stomach is going to explode and tear all my organs out, but because I&#039;ll be dying while people watch and take notes in bright yellow suits. When that happens, tell me&amp;#8230; will you feel anything? Any emotion at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t feel anything, it&#039;s that I&amp;#8230; can&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Fraise sets his clipboard down and stops taking notes.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; I have to&amp;#8230; stay strong. I have to keep pushing forward, no matter how much it hurts to watch you go. I never imagined I&#039;d ever be doing this, you know. I was an artist back on Earth. All I wanted to do was feel. But now, I can&#039;t feel anything at all. You have to understand. This is for all the other people out there who might be exposed to this very danger. This is&amp;#8230; I&#039;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s quite alright. Say, why don&#039;t you tell me more? About what life was like, back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; Me? But, you only have a few minutes left! Why are you so concerned about me? If you don&#039;t tell your story now, who will be around to tell it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to hear one last tale before I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, after I came to the Backrooms, I joined the M.E.G. because I thought it would be a fun little adventure&amp;#8230; just a little community of explorers. They found me in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/a&gt; and saved me. I never dreamed I&#039;d be doing something like this. I just wanted&amp;#8230; to live. This isn&#039;t life, watching people die from something I can do nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt; We shouldn&#039;t have experimented on the masks. In a way, I guess this our fault. We&#039;ve done nothing but put innocent people in harm&#039;s way trying to erase our mistakes. We did that with the mask experiments, and created the Masked Maidens. Now we did it with Level 10.1 and hurt the citizens of Malt Town, and you. I&#039;m so, so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;m not&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Heroux does not finish her sentence. She slumps back in her chair as her skin begins to bubble rapidly. Multiple boils erupt violently on the surface of her skin. Her eyes begin to glaze over in pain.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt; Holy shit&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you two&amp;#8230; have family? friends? lovers you left behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Heroux&#039;s voice is visibly strained, and grows weaker rapidly.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Why don&#039;t we sing one last song together. My Bonnie&amp;#8230; Lies Over the Ocean, do you know that one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt; I- yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt; Good. I&#039;ll begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Bonnie lies over the ocean,&lt;br /&gt;
My Bonnie lies over the sea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Bonnie lies over the ocean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bring back my Bonnie to me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back, bring back,&lt;br /&gt;
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,&lt;br /&gt;
Bring back, bring back,&lt;br /&gt;
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night as I lay on my pillow,&lt;br /&gt;
Last night as I lay on my bed,&lt;br /&gt;
Last night as I lay on my pillow,&lt;br /&gt;
I dreamt that my Bonnie was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Felix Fraise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back, bring back,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Penny A. Hayes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amelie Heroux:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back, bring back,&lt;br /&gt;
Oh bring back my Bonnie to&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Heroux shudders, as an audible tearing sound can be heard from inside her abdomen. She slumps over further in her chair as blood begins to leak from her mouth. A large bulge grows underneath her stomach, stretching her skin, until the substance violently bursts forth, killing Heroux instantly.]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Operative Hayes and Operative Fraise have since resigned from the M.E.G. and have refused to provide any further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;REPORT END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

It is located approximately twenty miles, or forty kilometers, from the nearest inhabited settlement: Malt Town. Despite being an easily accessible location, and theoretically still a constituent of the Level 10 plane, this area was given the appellation of &quot;Sub-section&quot; in hopes of highlighting the erratic and highly perilous properties of this particular region.</p> <p>The lake is radioactive, toxic, and carnivorous. It was created out of extensive failed attempts at neutralizing instances of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a> through extreme heat. Attempting to destroy an instance of Object 24 through melting it only creates a highly dangerous, semi-sentient chemical solution that seeks out the nearest living animal, including humans, and proceeds to consume it through liquidation. Due to the extremely perilous nature of this mixture, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">the M.E.G.</a> have declared Level 10.1 to be the designated location to dump said liquid in hopes of nullifying its detrimental effects.</p> <p>The radiation level within one square mile of the lake's surface is about 700 roentgens per hour, or approximately 7&#160;Sv/hr. For comparison, the radiation level of the reactor hall of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is 34&#160;Sv/hr and can kill a human being in less than ten to twenty minutes. Standing adjacent to Corpse Lake for more than an hour is fatal. Because of the M.E.G.'s lack of supply of radioactive protective gear, <strong>nobody, including M.E.G. personnel, is allowed to travel within ten square miles, or approximately 26 square kilometers, without express permission from the Overseers.</strong> Because of the extreme toxicity of this environment, those who enter the ten mile radius, now designated as the Corpse Lake Exclusion Zone, will receive no further help or contact from any M.E.G. personnel and will be henceforth be considered deceased. From the moment one enters the Corpse Lake Exclusion Zone, one's skin and clothes will be too contaminated for the M.E.G. to be able to offer assistance of any kind. Over the course of nine months, studies have shown that the radiation level of Corpse Lake has been gradually increasing since the initial creation incident, which displayed a large influx of the substance and thus contributed to such a high number. It is unknown what the cause of it is, and if or when this increase in radiation will effect nearby settlements such as Malt Town.</p> <h1><span>Biotic and Abiotic Properties:</span></h1> <div class="scp-image-block block-left" style="width:400px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/unknown.png" style="width:400px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:400px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Graph of radiation levels of Corpse Lake over time in roentgens/h.</p> </div> </div> <p>It is unknown what exactly makes Corpse Lake so radioactive. It is assumed to be one of the repercussions of trying to eliminate Object 24 instances. While inanimate, these masks conscientiously resist being destroyed, and thus it can be assumed that both the constant radiation emitted and the fluid's aggressive, hostile nature can be accredited to a sort of defensive mechanism. Debate is still ongoing as to whether or not Object 24, and by extension the fluid remains of it, can be truly considered &quot;alive&quot;. From previous reports, the lake appears to retain some sort of sentience and memory, behaving especially threatening towards personnel that were directly involved in the masks' destruction. Quite a number of casualties have occurred since this solution's accidental creation, and the grim reminders of them still lie within it to this day. At first, the mixture was pitch black in color, but has since turned a murky crimson after the blood of several fallen operatives was absorbed through exsanguination. At the time of writing, a year has passed without any similar incidents occurring. The blood has yet to dissolve, and no victims have been reported since August 12th, 2021. This leads to the conclusion that either the solution is not alive, or it can sustain itself without ingesting other living beings or digesting the blood that still sits on its surface.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-left" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/46029305242_4c91958431_b.png" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Photo of the ultraviolet veins in a petri dish of a liquified Object 24 instance.</p> </div> </div> <p>It is unknown what exactly causes the radiation that the solution emits. It is considered too dangerous, and the M.E.G. is too ill-equipped in terms of protective gear to safely analyze the substance. As such, the elemental composition of the liquid is entirely unknown. When the liquid was created, several small portions of it were contained in petri dishes and analyzed before the M.E.G. operatives died of radiation positioning. The information gathered by these valiant people comprises the majority of what we know now about the mystery liquid that makes up sub-section 10.1, however little that is. Included is a picture of a petri dish containing the liquid taken using ultraviolet imaging. The liquid appears to contain a network of strange pathways that only emit ultraviolet light and no other wavelength. Invisible to the naked eye, it seems as if the liquid created by the masks contains several &quot;veins&quot; of some manner. The M.E.G. hypothesizes that these veins are what carry nutrients gained by the liquid to the center. It has been noted that in the exact center of whatever shape the liquid takes, there is a large black area that cannot be penetrated with any form of light. This makes the area darker than the darkest visible shade known to man, Vantablack. It is unknown what the exact purpose of this black spot is, but its apparent function can be likened to that of a heart.</p> <h1><span>Deconstruction of Victims:</span></h1> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="noteblock"> <h1><span><span style="color:red">⚠️ <tt>CONTENT WARNING</tt> ⚠️</span></span></h1> <hr /> <p>The following description contains graphic depictions of the way in which the substance of Level 10.1 causes the untimely and gruesome demises of wanderers who come in unprotected contact with it. While it is encouraged that one reads the article in whole in order to fully understand the dangers of both this Sub-section and this substance, the details listed below are potentially discomforting.</p> </div> </div> <br /> <div style="text-align: left;"> <h2><span>Radiation Poisoning:</span></h2> <p>Upon coming in contact with radiation from the substance of Level 10.1, wanderers will develop radiation poisoning. This is constant no matter how much radiation wanderers are exposed to, whether it be a lethal dosage or what would normally be non-harmful. This makes exposure to the substance incredibly dangerous, as coming in contact with even the smallest amount of radiation, even though a protective suit, spells guaranteed death within the next hour. Radiation levels have been measured to be deadly as little as one centimeter inside the Exclusion Zone, and yet the area outside of it remains completely radiation-free (except for one notable exception, described in an attached report.)</p> <p>Wanderers who become afflicted with radiation sickness from Level 10.1 develop all the major symptoms of it within thirty minutes. Observation has proven that all wanderers will go through three distinct stages within an hour of contamination before eventually passing away.</p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-5141474451320910820" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="footerbox"> <h4><span><tt><span style="color: white">Stage One:</span></tt> <span class="footerspan"><tt><span style="color: grey">Within 10 minutes of contamination</span></tt></span></span></h4> </div> <div class="footerflavor"> <p>Wanderers begin to experience strong nausea and dizziness, with occasional vomiting. Headaches have been reported, and mild fevers begin to develop. Sporadic boils begin to appear on wanderers' skin. Many claim that they have felt fatigued, and there have been several cases of stomachaches and cramps.</p> </div> <hr /> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-4947436441572472786" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="footerbox"> <h4><span><tt><span style="color: white">Stage Two:</span></tt> <span class="footerspan"><tt><span style="color: grey">Within 30 minutes of contamination</span></tt></span></span></h4> </div> <div class="footerflavor"> <p>Wanderers experience a large and grotesque outbreak of boils covering their entire body. Many of them expand and burst, exposing blood to the open environment. Vomiting becomes extreme and violent, with occasional blood leakage. Stomachaches become nearly unbearable, causing wanderers to keel over in pain. Disorientation inundates many wanderers at this stage, causing them to lose consciousness. Studies have shown that many wanderers at this stage start to bleed internally, and their stomach acid begins to destroy the protective coating in the stomach and eat through their body from the inside by unknown means.</p> </div> <hr /> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-21104304451537656532" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="footerbox"> <h4><span><tt><span style="color: white">Stage Three:</span></tt> <span class="footerspan"><tt><span style="color: grey">Within 60 minutes of contamination</span></tt></span></span></h4> </div> <div class="footerflavor"> <p>This stage is the most gruesome and dangerous stage of the substance-induced radiation poisoning. Before a total of 60 minutes has elapsed since coming in contact with the radiation, all the blood within wanderers' body will converge and congeal in the center of their body. This motion will tear through a majority of the wanderers' vital organs and cause them to die through hemorrhaging. Once the wanderer is deceased, the substance will then burst forth from the victim's stomach and take on all the properties of the substance in the Corpse Lake. It will be just as radioactive, just as hostile, and just as dangerous. This has the potential for a domino effect of infection after infection if proper isolation and quarantining methods are not taken. Because the bodies of dead victims produce new amounts of this substance, those who develop radiation poisoning are to be considered dead and to be isolated from any other potential victims, regardless of whether or not they are wearing protective suits.</p> </div> <hr /> <h1><span>Physical Contact and Blood Draining:</span></h1> <p>The other primary way in which the substance, and by extension, Level 10.1, kills its prey is through direct physical contact with animal cells of any kind. Upon coming into contact with any part of a human's body, most likely the skin, the substance will begin to latch on and instantaneously solidify into a semi-solid of the same consistency and stickiness of a spider's web or coagulated glue. The substance will then begin to drain the victim's blood through the ultraviolet veins present in all parts of its amorphous figure. Nothing but the blood will be removed from the victim's body, and when every trace of it down to the atomic level is absorbed, the substance will automatically reverse its coagulation, return to a more liquid form, and retract from the cadaver, leaving naught but the wrinkled remains.</p> <p>For an unknown reason, this process will never happen to plant cells of any kind. As such, grass and other plants can freely grow on the banks of the lake. Algae species and other adjacent lifeforms, such as trichodesmium, have been observed to flourish in the lake. Experiments have been conducted in the past to sample specimens that survive in this otherwise perilous environment, and are logged below the list of casualties.</p> <h1><span>Archived Official M.E.G. Notice, Distributed to the Citizens of Malt Town, April 4th, 2021:</span></h1> <div class="footerbox"> <h4><span><tt><span style="color: white">NOTICE:</span></tt> <span class="footerspan"><tt><span style="color: grey">April 4th, 2021</span></tt></span></span></h4> </div> <div class="footerflavor"> <h3><span>Regarding Level 10.1:</span></h3> <p>The location for 10.1 was chosen due to the original depression containing an entrance to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-924">an undocumented level</a>. The reason this level remains undocumented is because there are no known entrances, and all who have previously entered have never been heard from afterwards. It was thought that the substance could be disposed of by hopefully pouring it into the depression to be transported to this level, but this has not been the case. Instead, it appears that Corpse Lake has been able to absorb a liquid coming <em>from</em> the level (presumably water) to increase its volume dramatically. Corpse Lake continues to grow in volume to this day, albeit at a very slow rate. Regardless, citizens of Malt Town are to kept on high alert at all times and to prepare for possible evacuations at a moment's notice.</p> </div> <br /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="whitebox"> <p><span class="footerspan"><tt><span style="color: grey">Compiled by Jeff A.

In addition to coloration and composition comparisons to control groups of these specimen, collected at the Fuchsia Embassy in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-121">Level 121</a>, radioactivity levels were also carefully monitored over the course of the experiment.</p> <p>Data from several trials show that microscopic particles of the Level 10.1 substance are present within each collected specimen from Corpse Lake, and behave with just as much intensity as a macroscopic amount of it. It appears that radiation level, along with volume, increases dramatically in proportion to the amount of water present in the nearby environment. This is consistent throughout all species of recovered aquatic life. Despite exhibiting radiation levels up to 456 roentgens/h, which is enough to cause detrimental effects, including mortality, on plant life, there was not a single instance recorded of that being the case. The results of this study suggest that only animal cells, and not plant cells, are susceptible to the harmful effects of the Level 10.1 substance.</p> <hr /> <h1><span>Case Study 1: Xanthophyte (Yellow-green algae)</span></h1> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:250px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/8732382368_63519f1831.png" style="width:250px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:250px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Irradiated xanthophyte sample.

Both petri dish samples were held under two 40-watt fluorescent tubes for a total of three consecutive days and were closely monitored. Radiation levels and volume of substance were documented and graphed below.</p> <p>As with all other trials, the control group's petri dish was contaminated as a result of unexpectedly intense radiation emitted from the irradiated algae after substance expansion. Both samples capped at 563.5 roentgens/h, which should have proven lethal to both algae specimens. However, both algae continued to grow after this point unbridled by this complication.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:650px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/unknown3.png" style="width:650px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:650px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Graph of radiation levels of case study xenophyte over 73 hour period.</p> </div> </div> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:650px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/unknown4.png" style="width:650px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:650px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Graph of substance volume over 73 hour period.</p> </div> </div> <hr /> <h1><span>Case Study 2: Trichodesmium</span></h1> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:250px;"><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/Thing"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/level-10-1/Thing/medium.jpg" style="width:250px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /></a> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:250px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Irradiated trichodesmium sample.</p> </div> </div> <p>After the results of the first set of trials, the petri dishes were replaced with radiation-resistant petri dishes in order to prevent contamination of the control group.

Experiments and comparisons were conducted between the two in order to elucidate any possible relations they might have, as well as to discover potentially new information about the origin, structure, and function of the Level 10.1 Substance.</p> <h1><span>Structure:</span></h1> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:250px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/27257707934_7d54c13a77_b.png" style="width:250px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:250px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Entity 19 sample.</p> </div> </div> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:250px;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-10-1/4966621857_e3952d2563_b.png" style="width:250px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:250px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Substance sample.</p> </div> </div> <p>Microscopic study reveals that the structures of Entity 19 and the Level 10.1 substance are similar but functionally different. The substance of Level 10.1 is not comprised of multiple individual bacteria like Entity 19, but is instead a chemical mixture of several radioactive molecules with suspended ultraviolet veins in its semi-gelatinous volume. It has been determined that these veins vary in structure. Some are made of a single layer of endothelial cells and can be likened to human capillaries, while others are made of connective tissue and can be likened to human superficial veins. Therefore, Entity 19 and the substance of Level 10.1 are fundamentally unique and are not related.</p> <p>The substance of Level 10.1 is also not a bacterium, despite its pathogenic effect. Both Entity 19 and the substance were contained in sterile containers and introduced to 1 μL<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-976488-2" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >2</a></sup> of human blood.</p> <p>Entity 19 immediately started producing liminatidin, which started accelerating primary coagulation, creating platelet clusters. In comparison, instead of affecting haemostasis, the substance of Level 10.1 used its veins to absorb and carry red blood cells throughout its venous system. A majority of the red blood cells, and in addition, its nutrients, were ferried through the substance into the black area at its center. The presence of blood in the veins is what gives the substance its signature crimson coloration.</p> <p>Both Entity 19 and the substance expanded rather quickly, but the substance expanded at a much greater rate than Entity 19. In a matter of hours, the substance had converted the 1 μL of blood into approximately 5 extra milliliters of volume, bring its total volume to 6 milliliters. For comparison, Entity 19 experienced an increase of only 1 ml of volume.</p> <p>In conclusion, Entity 19 and the substance of Level 10.1 are too different to be related.</p> <hr /> <h1><span>Additional Notes:</span></h1> <p>While consuming the 1 μL of blood, the substance of Level 10.1 emitted a sound inaudible to human ears at approximately 30 PHz<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-976488-3" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >3</a></sup> which was proportionally reconstructed at a frequency humans can hear.

If you don't tell your story now, who will be around to tell it?</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong> I want to hear one last tale before I go.</p> <p><strong>Operative Felix Fraise:</strong> Well, after I came to the Backrooms, I joined the M.E.G. because I thought it would be a fun little adventure&#8230; just a little community of explorers. They found me in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1">Level 1</a> and saved me. I never dreamed I'd be doing something like this. I just wanted&#8230; to live. This isn't life, watching people die from something I can do nothing about.</p> <p><strong>Operative Penny A. Hayes:</strong> We shouldn't have experimented on the masks. In a way, I guess this our fault. We've done nothing but put innocent people in harm's way trying to erase our mistakes. We did that with the mask experiments, and created the Masked Maidens. Now we did it with Level 10.1 and hurt the citizens of Malt Town, and you. I'm so, so sorry.</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong> I'm not&#8230;</p> <p>[[Heroux does not finish her sentence. She slumps back in her chair as her skin begins to bubble rapidly. Multiple boils erupt violently on the surface of her skin. Her eyes begin to glaze over in pain.]]</p> <p><strong>Operative Penny A. Hayes:</strong> Holy shit&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong> Do you two&#8230; have family? friends? lovers you left behind?</p> <p>[[Heroux's voice is visibly strained, and grows weaker rapidly.]]</p> <p><strong>Operative Penny A. Hayes:</strong> Of course.</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong> Why don't we sing one last song together. My Bonnie&#8230; Lies Over the Ocean, do you know that one?</p> <p><strong>Operative Felix Fraise:</strong> I- yes.</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong> Good. I'll begin.</p> <p>My Bonnie lies over the ocean,<br /> My Bonnie lies over the sea,</p> <p><strong>Operative Felix Fraise:</strong></p> <p>My Bonnie lies over the ocean,</p> <p><strong>Operative Penny A. Hayes:</strong></p> <p>So bring back my Bonnie to me&#8230;</p> <p><strong>All:</strong></p> <p>Bring back, bring back,<br /> Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,<br /> Bring back, bring back,<br /> Oh bring back my Bonnie to me!</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong></p> <p>Last night as I lay on my pillow,<br /> Last night as I lay on my bed,<br /> Last night as I lay on my pillow,<br /> I dreamt that my Bonnie was dead.</p> <p><strong>Operative Felix Fraise:</strong></p> <p>Bring back, bring back,</p> <p><strong>Operative Penny A. Hayes:</strong></p> <p>Oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,</p> <p><strong>Amelie Heroux:</strong></p> <p>Bring back, bring back,<br /> Oh bring back my Bonnie to&#8230;</p> <p>[[Heroux shudders, as an audible tearing sound can be heard from inside her abdomen. She slumps over further in her chair as blood begins to leak from her mouth. A large bulge grows underneath her stomach, stretching her skin, until the substance violently bursts forth, killing Heroux instantly.]]</p> <p>Both Operative Hayes and Operative Fraise have since resigned from the M.E.G. and have refused to provide any further information.</p> <h1><span>REPORT END</span></h1> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-20347101821539713057" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> </div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>By <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/kitty-rika">Kitty Rika</a><br /> Images:<br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/13cf1a0b-f3a5-4294-bde6-63a8c4744927">Corpse Lake</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/b1d2f106-5e8d-4077-b49f-80e0ad1ddca7">Petri Dish With Ultraviolet Veins</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/5fb1c769-2551-49d9-a803-d2242b38a819">Exclusion Zone 1</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/5cbe7d24-f17d-4b5f-8b07-11442d5a73ce">Exclusion Zone 2</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/93e388d5-ef49-47c5-b1dc-6ea396f1ebaa">Exclusion Zone 3</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/f4636f07-fd49-424f-8272-ff5ea06f12f0">Heat Press</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/0a327877-e886-43f6-9632-60477fd85a52">Deserted Facility</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/5ca40551-9dfa-4bfa-acbc-d4e7e43fb0d1">Microscopic Image of Substance</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/b861587a-c9a7-45df-8ba6-77a2ae843c4a">Microscopic Entity 19 Image</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/d6fc9edb-50b2-4eb4-bdbf-a794202834a0">Irradiated Trichodesmium</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/e4a65c77-555b-493b-b49e-86cbb13e39e7">Irradiated Algae</a><br /> <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/cd7601bd-ba10-419d-b606-1c7cddd5d07b">Amelie Heroux</a></p> <p>Distorted transmission by Thalamus Lab is licensed under CC BY 3.0 and is acquired from freesound.org.<br /> Geiger Counter Radioactive by ImAFoley is licensed under CC0 and is acquired from freesound.org.<br /> Graphs of radiation and all graphs for the aquatic plant life experiment, in addition to the animated GIF of Malt Town radiation levels, are all drawn by <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/rikas-author-page|">Kitty Rika</a> and licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.<br /> The song &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&quot; is part of Public Domain.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer-wikiwalk-nav"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p>&#171; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10">Level 10</a> | Level 10.1 | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-2">Level 10.2</a> &#187;</p> </div> </div> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-976488-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>.

				<title>The Snake Crawls Part 4: Nothing Is What It Seems</title>
				<link>http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-snake-crawls-part-4</link>
				<description>


&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 04th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;#8230; that was my most infamous mission. Still thinking about where I am in life today. This all meant so much to me. Still does, don&#039;t get me wrong. The Maidens were my new purpose. They are my true purpose. I felt like I belonged somewhere. Like I was able to fit with the puzzle of the universe. Sounds kind of cheesy but it&#039;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, days had passed. If that wasn&#039;t obvious, we had been on a few missions already. Janice and I got to know each other very well. We are still living within &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Level 67&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;The M.E.G.&lt;/a&gt; spy wasn&#039;t found at the time. Whatever they had been doing, they were hiding pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I was laying in my bed, facing towards the ceiling, fiddling around with my mask. The room had a window that emitted sunlight, but there was no outside space on the other side. It was strange to think about. Either way, as I was looking at the face of my mask, I had this spark. This motivation. I wanted to paint. Create an art piece. I haven&#039;t ever done that since&amp;#8230; I was back home. I felt at peace here. This is my new home. It fees just like home. I always was shy about it though. I didn&#039;t know what people would think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then stood up from my bed, leaving a small indent on the mattress as I got up from it, my feet touching the warm sunlight heated floorboards. I open my closet door from there. I found an art canvas and some paint buckets. It had a name engraved on it, &amp;quot;Orlando&amp;quot;. I took it out into the sunlight. The dust falling down from it made it look magical. I grabbed one of the two paintbrushes from the bottom of the canvas holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then dipped it into the paint, and I started to draw. I wanted to create a painting of my mask, in various colors. I then started… but before I could even get a good start, someone knocked, then opened my door. I quickly went to hide my art canvas. I couldn&#039;t have anyone see it. I rushed it back into the closet. My shirt got caught in it. Pulled up my sleeve in a rush. I didn&#039;t have time to pull it back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Kyra? Are you in there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; OH! Uhh- Ah- Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Heha! There you are! I knew you would be here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Uhh, yeah!&amp;#8230; Wh- what, brings you here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; I decided to see how my friend was doing! Got to make sure they are okay right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well that&#039;s very thoughtful of you! I&#039;m doing fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh. Sounds like you were in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Nah! I just&amp;#8230; I- I was jogging around my room in circles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Really? Heh. Are you sure about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! I&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Kyra&amp;#8230; then what&#039;s on your arm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Aa- Uhh- N- Nothin&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The sound of items crashing down emitted from my closet. I then quickly pulled down my sleeve while she wasn&#039;t looking.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; What was&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well uhh, you shouldn&#039;t&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Woah! Krya&amp;#8230; Wait&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. It- it&#039;s dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; No this name&amp;#8230; Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You knew this person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Orlando Richards was the man behind your mask before you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; What? Wow&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I knew him. He was our a part of our Team. He loved to paint and create art. This was his room. I didn&#039;t know we still had this canvas here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh- what happened to him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; He got taken by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6&quot;&gt;Duller&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt; before it changed. We tried to chase after it but it was fast. His mask fell off as the thing was running with him. It was holding him by the arm, it practically broke his arm since he got flung around by the damn thing. It can carry way more weight then it actually weighs. But it wasn&#039;t physically strong with its body; its body structure was weak. As it was running, it was stopped by a pack of two Smilers who started eating both the Duller and Orlando alive… We couldn&#039;t save him&amp;#8230; We couldn&#039;t even if we tried. All we had left was his mask. We then put it up in Level 0. And a year or two later you found it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I- I&#039;m so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s not your fault. You&#039;re fine. You actually may have heard his voice before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;I have&amp;#8230; it&#039;s how I knew to jump through the wall on our first mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; he was a good friend. You fit that mask really well too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; And&amp;#8230; was this what you were trying to hide from me&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I- Uhh&amp;#8230; yes&amp;#8230; I didn&#039;t know what you&#039;d think of me. That I paint and stuff&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; But Kyra! You paint! That is so cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; yeah I do. I haven&#039;t done it since I was back in the normal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Then, why hide it from me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ever since I started painting I- I didn&#039;t know what people would think of me. My parents wanted to me to dance and sing. I wanted that for myself too. They didn&#039;t want me to waste my time on art. I was just always&amp;#8230; drawn to it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; if you&#039;re drawn to it. It&#039;s best to draw on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(She had handed me the paintbrush, holding it from the brush itself.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I want you to paint for me. I think Orlando would&#039;ve wanted you to if he was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You- Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; you have inspired me to write poems again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I- I have!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! Heh&amp;#8230; I haven&#039;t done that since I was back in the real world either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I slowly walk up to the canvas, about to place the brush to the paper. Then I jolted back.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I can&#039;t&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; You can! Give it a try! Trust me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I- I&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t know&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Janice walked up to the canvas, grabbing the second brush at the bottom.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you won&#039;t do it yourself&amp;#8230; I&#039;ll do it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Look&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(She then placed it on the canvas, brush dripping with purple. My favorite color. She slowly swiped it across the paper.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you wanna paint Kyra?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to make a version of my mask full of pretty colors&amp;#8230; but now that you&#039;re here. Why not make both of our masks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Half yours and half mine? Full of colors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; yeah! I&#039;d love that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(She looked at me with a smirk on her face, then she grabbed my hand.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well then&amp;#8230; let&#039;s begin! Never be afraid of what makes you special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We painted for hours. She was really amazing at it. We should&#039;ve done it more often&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry I&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on, this shown me how much she really cared for me. That I had met someone that would bother to give me this connection with them. It&#039;s all I ever wanted. Well after we finished, we stood back and admired the amazing painting we made together. It showed our masks fused together. My side was mostly purple. Janice&#039;s side was mostly blue. I found out her favorite color is blue. The painting had many different paint splats of colors. Green, orange, yellow, red and much more. Black filled in the eyes and mouth for each side. It was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish it would&#039;ve lasted longer, because after that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182&quot;&gt;Masked Messengers&lt;/a&gt; flew in the room. We were called in by Sub-Sector Colombina and Pantalone. This was important. We walked out of my room and we traveled towards the main command center. When we got there, we were greeted by The Madam herself. Janice and I both bowed down in front of her. The Madam pinched the sides of her dress and lifted them slightly as she curtsied with us. She then started to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Greetings, dear Maidens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Madam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And you must be Kyra! We have already heard so many great things about you. You must feel very welcomed here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! Yeah! Feels just like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fantastic! I am here today to discuss a very important matter about your first mission. Amanda, may you please inform them on our discovery?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of course Madam. You see Janice, when you and Kyra had brought home the USB key full of various M.E.G. data. We analyzed the various videos on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Object 24&lt;/a&gt; Experiment location. We could finally put an end to the corruption. However, it never matched any of our categorized Levels in our database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; So you want me to analyze the Level location with my extensive Backrooms knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Precisely! You were right the past four times previously and those were all successful missions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There is a reason you are one of our best Maidens Janice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! And a good friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh&amp;#8230; well, I&#039;m gonna need to analyze it myself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right! Here&#039;s the drive with all you need!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks! I guess I&#039;ll see you later Kyra. You can catch up with me when you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;ll be there soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Janice ran off into the distance, going to analyze the Level details to find where this experiment lab is.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So&amp;#8230; why don&#039;t we have more categorized Levels? Don&#039;t we have &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939&quot;&gt;Level 939&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, The Reflection has mirrors that are inactive. Some mirrors take months to even years to activate. But when they do, they are activated for as long as we&#039;ve known.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And our population of Maidens is smaller the The M.E.G. as they have a lot more operatives and time to explore multiple Levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ahh. I guess that makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Janice had gave us four successful missions from identifying Levels since she is the Maiden that has been to the most locations in The Backrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Janice and Sully. Best to credit our best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well yes, but he is always nonsensical. We never know what we&#039;re getting from him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, But he&#039;s still a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well if you say so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A Maiden then walked up on us during the conversation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay sorry to interrupt but- OH! Greetings Madam!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mackie Guilford at our service once more I presume?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed Madam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Have you returned with news about the M.E.G. spy within our main Station?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No sadly. I came back to tell Kyra that she is needed by Janice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! I&#039;ll be there right away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was excited. Were we finally gonna end the corruption for a little while? Even if it wasn&#039;t long, that would be a huge success! My mind was thinking all kinds of things. How would we celebrate? I wanted to complete this mission. We weren&#039;t going out for it, as another Maidens team would be sent out. But I was just as excited as if I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran as quickly as I could to the data center room. I saw Janice sitting in a chair, looking through the footage. I watched with her as it showed a glass room. It was poorly-made glass, as it was starting to crack from the attacks of the patient inside. He was already wearing a mask. It was a Volto mask wearer. As the footage was playing in slow motion, Janice spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; You see this? This poor human being. Caged like an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&amp;#8230; that&#039;s horrible. I&#039;d rather be trapped within The Backrooms alone then be experimented on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely. We live in a crazy world with equally crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah I learnt that the hard way&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well you see those boxes right there&amp;#8230;? Those are food packaging boxes. And that over there is some equipment packed away, taped on the blue wooden paneling at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So&amp;#8230; what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Could just be miscellaneous equipment, but there is something familiar about it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; What&#039;s that in the corner? It&#039;s also dripping in front of the glass here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; That is what I was getting to&amp;#8230; the black goo&amp;#8230; I need more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Janice then changed the video to another experiment log.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice&lt;/strong&gt; FrostFluff is a cookie brand only ever seen within two Levels&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-176&quot;&gt;Level 176&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-20&quot;&gt;Level 20&lt;/a&gt;. And judging that 176 is a grocery store&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; That would mean it would be Level 20?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! That&#039;s it! I am confident that is it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay! Let&#039;s go tell the others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; On it! This is very important to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We burst out the door, running to the command room. I almost tripped on my own feet I was so excited. Janice and I turned around the corner and accidentally ran into some Maidens; we apologized while we continued sprinting to the command room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the command room with The Madam and Amanda Wright. We proceeded to tell them the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ahh! My dear Maidens. I was hoping you&#039;d come back with effective news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed we have Madam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wonderful! What may it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; We believe that The M.E.G. has a secret experiment base in Leve&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Janice doubles over in the middle of her sentences, choking on her words.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;Janice&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;Uhh&amp;#8230; is everything alright&amp;#8230;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Janice&amp;#8230;? What&#039;s up&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Uuuuhhh&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-286&quot;&gt;Level 286&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; They are hiding within The Electroscape. Find a maintenance door in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3&quot;&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt; and plug in the computer. You&#039;ll be transported there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh- but I thought we agreed on Level&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Trust me on this&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; B- but&amp;#8230; okay. I trust you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Then it is settled! To The Electroscape and to hell with the corruption!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Great job Janice! We&#039;ll be sending a team right away! You will have the honor to oversee this mission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&amp;#8230; thank you Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thank you Janice! We couldn&#039;t have found this without you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madam Evangeline:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well let&#039;s begin the show!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Let&#039;s hope this works&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was it. This was the mission that people would remember. I would be recognized by people. Loved by people. We would have people care for what we did. Amanda went back to her Station. I assumed the Team she assigned lived there. The Madam thanked us for our bravery and discovery. I couldn&#039;t believe it. My hands were shaking from the excitement. I just wanted people to care for me all my life down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was all thanks to Janice. She shown me that there is nothing to be afraid of. That I can be something in life down here. That I mattered. To not be afraid of what makes me special. And that my mistakes is what makes me human. It&#039;s what makes me perfect&amp;#8230;. she was perfect to me. I needed to tell her something. I at first, didn&#039;t know if I had the strength to do it, but she had showed me not to be afraid&amp;#8230; I had to tell her&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had to tell her how much I loved her&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something I need to show you&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something was horribly wrong&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission Log:&lt;/strong&gt; 287&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; 6/05/2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Fate of Strike Team&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an audio recording of the troubles of a Maiden Strike Team during their raid on a Level known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-286&quot;&gt;Level 286&lt;/a&gt; with Janice Haley as the overseer of this mission. The team&#039;s efforts have been saved as a part of this Entry when Maiden Ronald Hector, a Buskin Mask user survived the ordeal and returned to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Level 67&lt;/a&gt; with serious injuries. Ronald is now safe in Maiden Station 1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-153&quot;&gt;Level 153&lt;/a&gt;. Janice was communicating from afar with various communication devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The Team had reached the entranceway to the computer room as the audio device was activated.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay, we have just connected the computer system and showtime is imminent&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The sounds of large machinery had faded away.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sasha &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And the lights are gone. It&#039;s dark&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trent &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Heheheh&amp;#8230; Seems that way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, how long do we have to wait, dear captain?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Not too long&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right, of course&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We don&#039;t have much time to wait. But it seems that we must.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Approximately 2 hours had passed.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sasha &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay. I&#039;m done. We&#039;re not getting anywhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trent &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Haha! Calm down Sasha! I think I should be complaining. Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sasha &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sitting here with your constant giggling is so bothering me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;May you please stop the bickering?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The lights had came back by this point and the Team moved on.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trent &amp;quot;Arlecchino&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you think I look good for the party? Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sasha &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shut up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The Team had reached the given location)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This seems to be it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Will you elaborate if this is the stage you had given us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup! Seems right to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sasha &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wait&amp;#8230; who are&amp;#8230;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Gunshots sounded as Ash yelling out for Sasha could be heard. The rest ran for cover.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What!? Where did these weapons come from!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;These guys are not M.E.G.! They are The Insurrection! We are sitting ducks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Then wh-&lt;/em&gt; Gah fuck! My mask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A bullet had almost hit Ronald before he jumped back as his mask fell off.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Are you okay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&amp;#8230; what the fuck is going on!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;They must be putting all their efforts in protecting something. There aren&#039;t many firearms in this world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Where the fuck is Trent!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;On the other side. I hope he&#039;s not planning on sneaking up on them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Shit&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Captain! What is going o&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Powerful sounds of electricity flows through the audio.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Wh&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; What the hell is that thing!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!&amp;#8230; OOOOOOOOOOUUUT!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Comms are dead! We&#039;re stu- AAH!&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The audio had then cut out for a solid 3 minutes before coming back. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Intense heavy breathing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#039;ve been&amp;#8230; I&#039;ve been running forever. Trent, Ash, Sasha they&#039;re all gone! That fucking- th- thing electrocuted Trent a- and Ash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald &amp;quot;Buskin&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#039;t know where to go&amp;#8230; I&#039;m going to turn this off. That thing could be anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of Audio Log.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>June 04th, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>Well&#8230; that was my most infamous mission. Still thinking about where I am in life today. This all meant so much to me. Still does, don't get me wrong. The Maidens were my new purpose. They are my true purpose. I felt like I belonged somewhere. Like I was able to fit with the puzzle of the universe. Sounds kind of cheesy but it's true.</p> <p>Well, days had passed. If that wasn't obvious, we had been on a few missions already. Janice and I got to know each other very well. We are still living within <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67">Level 67</a>. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> spy wasn't found at the time. Whatever they had been doing, they were hiding pretty well.</p> <p>During this time I was laying in my bed, facing towards the ceiling, fiddling around with my mask. The room had a window that emitted sunlight, but there was no outside space on the other side. It was strange to think about. Either way, as I was looking at the face of my mask, I had this spark. This motivation. I wanted to paint. Create an art piece. I haven't ever done that since&#8230; I was back home. I felt at peace here. This is my new home. It fees just like home. I always was shy about it though. I didn't know what people would think of it.</p> <p>I then stood up from my bed, leaving a small indent on the mattress as I got up from it, my feet touching the warm sunlight heated floorboards. I open my closet door from there. I found an art canvas and some paint buckets. It had a name engraved on it, &quot;Orlando&quot;. I took it out into the sunlight. The dust falling down from it made it look magical. I grabbed one of the two paintbrushes from the bottom of the canvas holder.</p> <p>I then dipped it into the paint, and I started to draw. I wanted to create a painting of my mask, in various colors. I then started… but before I could even get a good start, someone knocked, then opened my door. I quickly went to hide my art canvas. I couldn't have anyone see it. I rushed it back into the closet. My shirt got caught in it. Pulled up my sleeve in a rush. I didn't have time to pull it back down.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Kyra? Are you in there?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> OH! Uhh- Ah- Yeah!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Heha! There you are! I knew you would be here!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Uhh, yeah!&#8230; Wh- what, brings you here?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well&#8230; I decided to see how my friend was doing! Got to make sure they are okay right?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well that's very thoughtful of you! I'm doing fine!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Heh. Sounds like you were in a rush.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Nah! I just&#8230; I- I was jogging around my room in circles!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Really? Heh. Are you sure about that?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah! I&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Kyra&#8230; then what's on your arm?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Aa- Uhh- N- Nothin&#8212;</p> <p><em>(The sound of items crashing down emitted from my closet. I then quickly pulled down my sleeve while she wasn't looking.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> What was&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well uhh, you shouldn't&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Woah! Krya&#8230; Wait&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I know. It- it's dumb.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> No this name&#8230; Orlando.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You knew this person?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Orlando Richards was the man behind your mask before you found it.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> What? Wow&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I knew him. He was our a part of our Team. He loved to paint and create art. This was his room. I didn't know we still had this canvas here.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wh- what happened to him?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> He got taken by a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6">Duller</a> in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a> before it changed. We tried to chase after it but it was fast. His mask fell off as the thing was running with him. It was holding him by the arm, it practically broke his arm since he got flung around by the damn thing. It can carry way more weight then it actually weighs. But it wasn't physically strong with its body; its body structure was weak. As it was running, it was stopped by a pack of two Smilers who started eating both the Duller and Orlando alive… We couldn't save him&#8230; We couldn't even if we tried. All we had left was his mask. We then put it up in Level 0. And a year or two later you found it&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I- I'm so sorry.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> It's not your fault. You're fine. You actually may have heard his voice before.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;I have&#8230; it's how I knew to jump through the wall on our first mission.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah&#8230; he was a good friend. You fit that mask really well too.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> And&#8230; was this what you were trying to hide from me&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I- Uhh&#8230; yes&#8230; I didn't know what you'd think of me. That I paint and stuff&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> But Kyra! You paint! That is so cool!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah&#8230; yeah I do. I haven't done it since I was back in the normal world.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Then, why hide it from me?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ever since I started painting I- I didn't know what people would think of me. My parents wanted to me to dance and sing. I wanted that for myself too. They didn't want me to waste my time on art. I was just always&#8230; drawn to it&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well&#8230; if you're drawn to it. It's best to draw on it!</p> <p><em>(She had handed me the paintbrush, holding it from the brush itself.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I want you to paint for me. I think Orlando would've wanted you to if he was here.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You- Why?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well&#8230; you have inspired me to write poems again!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I- I have!?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah! Heh&#8230; I haven't done that since I was back in the real world either.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wow&#8230; I don't&#8230;</p> <p><em>(I slowly walk up to the canvas, about to place the brush to the paper. Then I jolted back.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I can't&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> You can! Give it a try! Trust me&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I- I&#8230; I don't know&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Here&#8230;</p> <p><em>(Janice walked up to the canvas, grabbing the second brush at the bottom.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> If you won't do it yourself&#8230; I'll do it with you.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wh-</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Look&#8230;</p> <p><em>(She then placed it on the canvas, brush dripping with purple. My favorite color. She slowly swiped it across the paper.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> What do you wanna paint Kyra?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I wanted to make a version of my mask full of pretty colors&#8230; but now that you're here. Why not make both of our masks?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Half yours and half mine? Full of colors!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah&#8230; yeah! I'd love that!</p> <p><em>(She looked at me with a smirk on her face, then she grabbed my hand.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well then&#8230; let's begin! Never be afraid of what makes you special.</p> </div> <hr /> <p>We painted for hours. She was really amazing at it. We should've done it more often&#8230;.</p> <p>Sorry I&#8230;</p> <p>Continuing on, this shown me how much she really cared for me. That I had met someone that would bother to give me this connection with them. It's all I ever wanted. Well after we finished, we stood back and admired the amazing painting we made together. It showed our masks fused together. My side was mostly purple. Janice's side was mostly blue. I found out her favorite color is blue. The painting had many different paint splats of colors. Green, orange, yellow, red and much more. Black filled in the eyes and mouth for each side. It was beautiful.</p> <p>I wish it would've lasted longer, because after that, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182">Masked Messengers</a> flew in the room. We were called in by Sub-Sector Colombina and Pantalone. This was important. We walked out of my room and we traveled towards the main command center. When we got there, we were greeted by The Madam herself. Janice and I both bowed down in front of her. The Madam pinched the sides of her dress and lifted them slightly as she curtsied with us. She then started to speak.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Greetings, dear Maidens.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Madam.</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>And you must be Kyra! We have already heard so many great things about you. You must feel very welcomed here.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh! Yeah! Feels just like home.</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Fantastic! I am here today to discuss a very important matter about your first mission. Amanda, may you please inform them on our discovery?</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Of course Madam. You see Janice, when you and Kyra had brought home the USB key full of various M.E.G. data. We analyzed the various videos on the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a> Experiment location. We could finally put an end to the corruption. However, it never matched any of our categorized Levels in our database.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> So you want me to analyze the Level location with my extensive Backrooms knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Precisely! You were right the past four times previously and those were all successful missions!</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>There is a reason you are one of our best Maidens Janice.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah! And a good friend!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Heh&#8230; well, I'm gonna need to analyze it myself first.</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Right! Here's the drive with all you need!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Thanks! I guess I'll see you later Kyra. You can catch up with me when you can!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I'll be there soon!</p> <p><em>(Janice ran off into the distance, going to analyze the Level details to find where this experiment lab is.)</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So&#8230; why don't we have more categorized Levels? Don't we have <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939">Level 939</a>?</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Well, The Reflection has mirrors that are inactive. Some mirrors take months to even years to activate. But when they do, they are activated for as long as we've known.</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>And our population of Maidens is smaller the The M.E.G. as they have a lot more operatives and time to explore multiple Levels.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ahh. I guess that makes more sense.</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Janice had gave us four successful missions from identifying Levels since she is the Maiden that has been to the most locations in The Backrooms.</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Janice and Sully. Best to credit our best.</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Well yes, but he is always nonsensical. We never know what we're getting from him.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah, But he's still a good friend.</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Well if you say so.</em></p> <p><em>(A Maiden then walked up on us during the conversation.)</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Okay sorry to interrupt but- OH! Greetings Madam!</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Mackie Guilford at our service once more I presume?</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Indeed Madam.</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Have you returned with news about the M.E.G. spy within our main Station?</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>No sadly. I came back to tell Kyra that she is needed by Janice.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Oh! I'll be there right away!</p> </div> <hr /> <p>I was excited. Were we finally gonna end the corruption for a little while? Even if it wasn't long, that would be a huge success! My mind was thinking all kinds of things. How would we celebrate? I wanted to complete this mission. We weren't going out for it, as another Maidens team would be sent out. But I was just as excited as if I was there.</p> <p>I ran as quickly as I could to the data center room. I saw Janice sitting in a chair, looking through the footage. I watched with her as it showed a glass room. It was poorly-made glass, as it was starting to crack from the attacks of the patient inside. He was already wearing a mask. It was a Volto mask wearer. As the footage was playing in slow motion, Janice spoke.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> You see this? This poor human being. Caged like an animal.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah&#8230; that's horrible. I'd rather be trapped within The Backrooms alone then be experimented on.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Definitely. We live in a crazy world with equally crazy people.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah I learnt that the hard way&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well you see those boxes right there&#8230;? Those are food packaging boxes. And that over there is some equipment packed away, taped on the blue wooden paneling at the bottom.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So&#8230; what is it?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Could just be miscellaneous equipment, but there is something familiar about it…</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> What's that in the corner? It's also dripping in front of the glass here.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> That is what I was getting to&#8230; the black goo&#8230; I need more.</p> <p><em>(Janice then changed the video to another experiment log.)</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> There&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> What is that?</p> <p><strong>Janice</strong> FrostFluff is a cookie brand only ever seen within two Levels&#8230; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-176">Level 176</a> and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-20">Level 20</a>. And judging that 176 is a grocery store&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> That would mean it would be Level 20?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yes! That's it! I am confident that is it!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Okay! Let's go tell the others!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> On it! This is very important to get right.</p> </div> <hr /> <p>We burst out the door, running to the command room. I almost tripped on my own feet I was so excited. Janice and I turned around the corner and accidentally ran into some Maidens; we apologized while we continued sprinting to the command room.</p> <p>We reached the command room with The Madam and Amanda Wright. We proceeded to tell them the discovery.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Ahh! My dear Maidens. I was hoping you'd come back with effective news.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Indeed we have Madam.</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Wonderful! What may it be?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> We believe that The M.E.G. has a secret experiment base in Leve&#8212;</p> <p><em>(Janice doubles over in the middle of her sentences, choking on her words.)</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> &#8230;Janice&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>&#8230;Uhh&#8230; is everything alright&#8230;?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Janice&#8230;? What's up&#8230;?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Uuuuhhh&#8230; <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-286">Level 286</a>&#8230; They are hiding within The Electroscape. Find a maintenance door in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3">Level 3</a> and plug in the computer. You'll be transported there.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wh- but I thought we agreed on Level&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Trust me on this&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> B- but&#8230; okay. I trust you.</p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Then it is settled! To The Electroscape and to hell with the corruption!</em></p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Great job Janice! We'll be sending a team right away! You will have the honor to oversee this mission.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yes&#8230; thank you Amanda.</p> <p><strong>Amanda:</strong> <em>Thank you Janice! We couldn't have found this without you.</em></p> <p><strong>Madam Evangeline:</strong> <em>Well let's begin the show!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Okay. Let's hope this works&#8230;</p> </div> <hr /> <p>This was it. This was the mission that people would remember. I would be recognized by people. Loved by people. We would have people care for what we did. Amanda went back to her Station. I assumed the Team she assigned lived there. The Madam thanked us for our bravery and discovery. I couldn't believe it. My hands were shaking from the excitement. I just wanted people to care for me all my life down here.</p> <p>And it was all thanks to Janice. She shown me that there is nothing to be afraid of. That I can be something in life down here. That I mattered. To not be afraid of what makes me special. And that my mistakes is what makes me human. It's what makes me perfect&#8230;. she was perfect to me. I needed to tell her something. I at first, didn't know if I had the strength to do it, but she had showed me not to be afraid&#8230; I had to tell her&#8230;</p> <p><strong>I had to tell her how much I loved her&#8230;</strong></p> <p>But&#8230;</p> <p>There is something I need to show you&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Something was horribly wrong&#8230;</strong></p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Access&nbsp;Maidens&nbsp;Mission&nbsp;Log&nbsp;287</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Welcome,&nbsp;dear&nbsp;Maiden.</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"></div> <div class="borderblock"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h2><span><strong>MASKED MAIDENS</strong></span></h2> <h3><span><strong>DATABASE</strong></span></h3> </div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p><span class="rainbow2">TO MASK IS TO REVEAL&#8230;</span></p> </div> <hr /> <div class="styled-quote"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong>Mission Log:</strong> 287</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Date:</strong> 6/05/2021</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Subject:</strong> Fate of Strike Team</td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>This is an audio recording of the troubles of a Maiden Strike Team during their raid on a Level known as <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:level-286">Level 286</a> with Janice Haley as the overseer of this mission. The team's efforts have been saved as a part of this Entry when Maiden Ronald Hector, a Buskin Mask user survived the ordeal and returned to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67">Level 67</a> with serious injuries. Ronald is now safe in Maiden Station 1: <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-153">Level 153</a>.

Unless it's something we have yet to hear of, we suspect <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a> related interference. Their motives are unknown for now, but it's getting freaky for us when we're trying to do our jobs with those people &#8212; if that's what they even are anymore &#8212; watching us whilst we work.</p> <p>Could we request backup during our shifts for security reasons? I have a hunch that this may go wholly wrong.</p> <p>- Iris</p> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div class="darkblock"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">From:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO#moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">To:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB#moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">Subject:</span></strong> <span style="color: #ffffff">Re: Base Gamma Breach</span></td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>I understand your concerns pertaining to this slight breach of security. However, we all know that the danger posed by masked individuals is very low; the connection they hold towards the masks can be terminated with relative ease. Personally, I do not see this as an issue which requires further interference. I suggest you pay closer attention to our database entries for wall masks to see what needs to be done about this.</p> <p>For the time being, the request of security backup from our teams seems unnecessary. Try to handle this yourselves.</p> <p>- Overseer-C</p> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong>From:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB#moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>To:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO#moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Base Gamma Breach</td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>With all due respect, Overseer, I do not know of any cases where Masked individuals are this intrusive in nature to our activities as they are now. I should know, I've interacted with such wearers beforehand.</p> <p>I insist upon our request for backup or a potential upgrade in our weaponry so we can dispatch them more efficiently should anything occur. I state once more that something seems very off right now.</p> <p>- Iris</p> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div class="darkblock"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">From:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO#moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">To:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB#moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">Subject:</span></strong> <span style="color: #ffffff">Re: Base Gamma Breach</span></td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>We currently have our highest-quality weaponry being used in other missions as we speak. The B.N.T.G. have yet to retrieve more stock of such weaponry, and as far as priorities go, they are at the top as of now. If they can be handled with relative ease &#8212; as the Object 24 entry suggests they can &#8212; then I still do not see any valid reasons to approve this request.</p> <p>I highly doubt anything will occur. The entry in the database mentions the three methods of terminating mask connections, you should refer to that for the time being.</p> <p>- Overseer-C</p> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong>From:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB#moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>To:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO#moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Base Gamma Breach</td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>You don't understand, these are different than other mask wearers. A few days ago, Avril was outside the main gate holing her post like usual, when one of them which was wearing that one joke-telling mask wearers began to watch her. She didn't notice it at first, but when she did, it didn't just start telling it jokes like it normally would do; it just ran off, giggling feverishly as it turned the corner and went out of sight.</p> <p>This is not normal behavior. Something is terribly wrong, and you're just dismissing it based on what's in the article. It's not the first time an article's content wasn't correct. Some developments could've undergone related to the object that we have yet to hear of, which would hinder the information in the article redundant. Either way, we need to be prepared for whatever may happen.</p> <p>-Iris</p> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div class="darkblock"> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">From:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO#moc.liamkcab|gaEnACvO</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">To:</span></strong> <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB#moc.liamkcab|smaetdrauGammaGesaB</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">Subject:</span></strong> <span style="color: #ffffff">Re: Base Gamma Breach</span></td> </tr> </table> <hr /> <p>I see. I do believe it is possible that some defining traits of the different masks could have been missed during our studies. We are all human after all, and we all make mistakes &#8212; or at least that's what Overseer-A says.</p> <p>You seem to be describing the effects of the &quot;Arlecchino Mask&quot;. If they return and tell a joke, just respond with the appropriate action mentioned in the Entry. If the behavior differs from what is in the article, then I suggest improvising as time goes on. We have not seen anything like this before, so you are free to dispatch targets in any way that is needed.</p> <p>I don't have much time left to continue emailing you, as I have other duties which I am to correspond to soon enough.

I'll be glad to answer all your questions!</p> <p>So who am I? Sally, duh! I've already told you, you big dummy!</p> <p>What have I done with Iris? You worry too much Overseer! Iris is completely safe with me! Err, if bound up and gagged is considered completely safe, haha!</p> <p>What do I want? Oh, now <em>this</em> is a fun one. Let's say I <em>know some things</em> you've all been trying to hide from the herd of sheep you've gathered. I've just decided to play wolf and take the lost sheep with me somewhere else.</p> <p>If you want your precious sheep to be returned safe and sound, you'll have to play by <em>my</em> rules now :)</p> <p>Iris will remain alive for as long as you halt experimentation of Wall Masks on people. We'll feed her and keep her healthy for as long as she's with us, but if we find out that a <em>single</em> experiment has been carried out in the meantime, I'll personally make sure she curses your name out loud as she bleeds out on the floor. Sounds fun, right?</p> <p>Oh, and also, don't try to cheat the game. We'll know if you've done so regardless of if you hide it or not. It wouldn't be a fun game if we don't play by the rules!</p> <p>Anyhow, I'm going to be taking my leave for now.

I trust that you remember the emergency transfer that you were assigned, and that documentation of the incident was handled by another one of your crewmates, correct?</p> <p>There is, however&#8230; something which I have neglected to tell you. Something I have neglected to tell <em>all</em> of you. Keep what I am going to be telling you now between us at all costs.</p> <p>There is a group going around The Backrooms which are targeting people like you and I under the guise of eliminating corruption in our circles. They all bear instances of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a>, and they use the powers that the masks grant them to their full advantage to fulfill said goal.</p> <p>As you know, Iris' unknown assailant was reported by her to be masked. Let's just say that&#8230; this 'unknown assailant' was not really unknown at all. You can probably see where I am going with this.</p> <p>Prior to her death, me and Iris had been communicating via emails. This group, known as the Masked Maidens, had been stalking Base Gamma's guards for some time prior to her emailing, and Iris had brought it to my attention that night. I knew what she had meant when she began describing her stalkers immediately. I knew what the people she was talking about wanted from me. I knew what was going to happen to her, and I knew what they were going to do to her. This is not the first time I have played the game of chess with the Maidens.</p> <p>They requested for us to stop our experimentation on Object 24, something which we ultimately cannot do due to projects which I am afraid I cannot disclose to you. They put Iris' life to ransom, but that did little to stop me from continuing my work.</p> <p>As far as you, me, and everyone else in The Backrooms are concerned from this point onwards, Iris died from an unknown assailant who stealthily breached Base gamma. Research is still ongoing to determine who it was and what their motives were. That is what your team will write on the report that you will submit to me. I trust that you will follow what I have just said word for word.</p> <p>No mention of the Masked Maidens shall be included in this report, and you shall not speak of them at any point going onwards. It is imperative that we do not reveal anything about them to the public; I will handle them myself.</p> <p>As for you, this conversation never happened, and it would be a damn <em>shame</em> if it did.</p> <p><em><strong>Overseer-C</strong></em></p> </div> <hr /></div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>The original authors of this entry are <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713139" alt="Stretchsterz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" >Stretchsterz</a></span> and <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6864497&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713139" alt="Sariastuff" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6864497)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff" >Sariastuff</a></span>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="licensebox"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">‡&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;Licensing&nbsp;/&nbsp;Citation</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>Cite this page as:</p> <div class="colmod-block"> <ul> <li class="folded"> <ul> <li style="list-style: none">_</li> </ul> <div class="colmod-link-top"> <div class="foldable-list-container"><a href="javascript:;">+ Embed citation as HTML</a><a href="javascript:;">- Embed citation as HTML</a></div> </div> <div class="colmod-content"></div> <div> <div class="foldable-list-container"></div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <div class="content-separator" style="display: none:"></div> <p>For more information about on-wiki content, visit the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/licensing-master-list">Licensing Master List</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713139" alt="Stretchsterz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" >Stretchsterz</a></span></p>

They were closer, much closer than we anticipated, and there were several sets of them – not only that, but they were accompanied by the sound of rolling tires, the clanking of metal, and most foreboding of all, the lack of a single spoken word.</p> <p>From that, I gathered quickly that they were an organized team that didn’t need to shout order to communicate. That kind of swift efficiency bore down on our haphazard raggle-taggle group of unorganized runaways. As their footsteps quickened, as did ours, as what had been a silent creep turned into a chaotic cacophonous frenzy in a matter of seconds. We shed all form of evasiveness, for we knew we had been found. We blew past tunnels full of piping, assorted fixtures, and metal, kicking aside and trampling scraps of unwanted materials. Various shards of sharp objects and glass crunched under our feet as our assailants loomed closer.</p> <p>I could feel sweat forming on my brow as the temperature began to steadily rise the further we pressed onwards. The air became thick with the stench of hot iron embedded in the steam of our frenetic exhalation. From around the corner, I could see several elongated shadows creep up the far wall, cast by an unknown flashlight just around the bend. The light danced back and forth, searching for its prey, the deer caught in its headlights. Just as I saw the outline of an arm cross the threshold, I felt sweltering heat explode into my palms. I grit my teeth and heaved my arm forwards with all my weight, ripping into the fabric of reality with my claws and igniting my fingers with the friction. The world grew silent for a fragmented second before the ground in front of me flew into an infernal conflagration. The flames shot upwards, snatching the ceiling in its grasp and filling the room with incandescent light.</p> <p>I gaped in awe as I saw that between my fire’s angry tongues, several silhouettes flickered back and forth. I heard the sound of a large object being planted on the ground, and then an angry hissing scream above the noise. I felt a tug on my palm as my fire began to dwindle, writhing about like a great beast cause in a suffocating net.</p> <p>“Kimiko-sama!” Sagobe-san called from up ahead. She was already nearing the corner of the next hallway, shouting over the heads of all my other Masked Maiden brethren. She slowed down to call me, and the rest of my companions whizzed past her, blanketing her in a sea of bodies as she struggled to snap me out of my trance.</p> <p>“Don’t watch! You have to run, Kimiko-sama!”</p> <p>I closed my open palm into a fist, sparks flying between my knuckles. In that instant, I saw my clothes and hands disappear in my periphery as my body faded into intangibility. Invisible, I gasped as I saw the number of people that were chasing us. Most surprising of all, however, was the contraption that they carried with them, straddled by two men on either side. A gigantic garden hose, its length leading straight into a gargantuan tank hoisted up by four people at once. One man switched off the valve and its foamy spray shuttered to a halt, leaving no trace of my fire and the ground rife with puddles.</p> <p>Sagobe-san and the others had already rounded the corner. When the two men grabbed onto the sides of the garden hose’s wheel, life sprung back into my feet. I dashed around the corner as our assailants picked up the pursuit.</p> <p>Even an ethereal spirit such as myself was not immune to fatigue, and the blistering heat was not helping one bit. As the chase dragged on, I found that the pounding of my feet against the concrete of the ground and the wood of my sandals sent painful shocks throughout my body with each step. My breath caught in my throat, too scared to escape. Even with the added time that I had bought them, we were still losing ground, and fast.</p> <p>Guilt wormed its way into my heart as I realized the reason that we were being chased. For a secret organization, I had done a lousy job of keeping it secret. Over time, I had tried to infiltrate the M.E.G. on numerous occasions to gain vital intel for the rest of the Masked Maidens. That was my job, and I had done it poorly. I had allowed myself to be discovered, and I had allowed the M.E.G. to be able to develop a trap to hunt our entire group down using the form of a tracked file. And if we were caught here because I was unable to stall them for long enough to escape, it would be my fault, too. Despite the kitsune powers that I possessed, I was fundamentally useless as part of the Masked Maidens. Detrimental, even.</p> <p>“In here, quickly!” Sagobe-san shouted as I caught up to the rest of the group. She gesticulated wildly to her right, where there was a doorway. Beyond the doorway was a large room, ornately decorated in all sorts of suburban clutter. With a nostalgic pang, I realized that the room’s make was not unlike that of a typical Japanese home. It was that final straw that brought the tears in my eyes out. I revealed myself, no longer having neither the strength nor focus to keep up the magical cover. I let my arms hang limp as I choked on what little breath I had left.</p> <p>“Sagobe-san! It’s a dead end!” Marcus, one of my fellow Maidens, shouted from somewhere inside the room.</p> <p>“No, it’s not! Trust me, don’t hesitate. There’s no room for that. Just go in, all of you!”</p> <p>The fatigue caught up to me, clamping onto my legs like the jaws of a hungry tiger. Petrified, I stood, wringing my hands and sniffling uncontrollably. A hundred years lived and I looked like a human baby.</p> <p>“Kimiko-sama! Move!” Sagobe-san shouted. I whirled around as the footsteps approached us. A man rounded the bend and, in a frightening jolt of realization, I looked into his eyes. So many unspoken words that could never be described passed between us in that moment. Entity, myth, or human, our vibrations were the same in that instance. Then…</p> <p>Sagobe-san shoved me into the room, jumping in herself and slamming the door behind her.<br /> As I took in my surroundings, I realized suddenly that all the other members of the Masked Maidens that I had been with were nowhere in sight. The only person that I could see was right beside me – Kokona Sagobe, leader of the Kitsune sub-sector of the Masked Maidens. She dusted her hands off on her leather pants and looked at me.</p> <p>“Are you alright? Not too spent after using your powers?” she asked between breaths. I put a shaky hand on her shoulder to steady myself and bent over, regaining my breath. As such, I didn’t notice the room slowly begin to morph and change. The walls rearranged themselves, and all of a sudden, the lights shuttered and flickered out. I yelped as my world was thrown into darkness.</p> <p>“Sagobe-san? Are you still there? Where are you?” I shouted frantically. I jumped as I felt an arm around my back.</p> <p>“Don’t worry, Kimiko-sama. I’m right here.”</p> <p>“Where are the others?”</p> <p>“Most likely up ahead. Hold onto my hand and don’t let go. We’re in Level 64 right now; I could tell based on the entrance. You won’t be able to use your fire powers too much here, since it might burn your surroundings.”</p> <p>I grabbed ahold of Sagobe-san’s hand as she led the way through the darkness. I could feel clutter all around me, and the wood of my sandals crunches on various objects – wrappers, tinfoil, and other unidentified substances I really didn’t want to think about. We stepped gingerly around piles of furniture until we came across a hallway filled with dim white candles.</p> <p>An elaborate carpet with golden floral patterns lead the way down the corridor, and in the distance I could see several silhouettes shifting back and forth like a writhing mass of shadow. My heart pounded in my chest – was that our group, or had we just encountered our enemies?</p> <p>The silence was unnerving, and I preemptively turned invisible. Even in the darkness, I felt vulnerable. Sagobe-san guided me towards the throng, and as we grew closer I could pick out the outlines of masked individuals, some masks familiar faces that I recognized immediately. Kitsune masks and… Bauta masks?</p> <p>“We’re here, order from the Madam herself,” one of the Bauta mask wearers whispered to Sagobe-san the moment we approached them.</p> <p>“I’m sorry for putting you all through so much trouble,” Sagobe-san said tersely, dipping her head politely to then before joining the ranks of the Kitsune mask wearers behind the formation of Bauta mask wearers. I felt a pang of guilt – I should have said that, but Sagobe-san said it for me. Now I couldn’t take any of the blame for myself.</p> <p>“It’s not a problem. Nobody could have predicted that the M.E.G. would put a tracker on their own files. I’m sure that the Madam understands, as we do,” the Bauta mask wearer stated, evidently the head of the group. He had a deep masculine voice, the voice of Rafael Lawson, the Bauta mask leader.</p> <p>“Everyone has destroyed their devices, correct?” Sagobe-san asked as the atmosphere began to calm down. It was then I had the courage to remove my invisibility. Everyone nodded their heads, some more hesitantly than others. I could only imagine the memories and months, even years of stored data, destroyed as collateral for my mistake.</p> <p>While the M.E.G. were comprised of regular people – those with no outstanding supernatural abilities or powers, they were dangerous in their own right due to their adaptability. I shuddered when I recalled the giant water container and the portable garden hose that shot down my fire. They had come prepared, and now that our cover was blown, we had lost the element of surprise. With their greater numbers, even with my control over the element of fire, we were put at a disadvantage. It was almost pathetic how a figure who was revered and respected, hailed as a powerful and fearsome beast back in Japan, was put on the run like some frightened animal.</p> <p>When Sagobe-san stole the files from Base Alpha in Level 1, she brought back a copy of one particular file of interest: a file on me. Unbeknownst to myself and every other Masked Maiden, the M.E.G. was aware that I had been infiltrating their ranks in disguises, and had been secretly spying on me in retaliation. It was through this method, and the documentation of my first encounter with the M.E.G. when I first entered the Backrooms, that they were able to craft a plan to corner us. And so far, it was working flawlessly. The chances of us being able to escape unscathed were growing slimmer and slimmer, like the light at the end of a collapsing tunnel.</p> <p>“We’ll keep you all safe,” Lawson-san told us in a rough, no-nonsense manner. He was already moving past the crowd to stand at the edges, facing the entrance to the corridor. “My team and I will take the front and rear ends and watch for any incoming meggies. Kokona, you know about Level 64, right? Focus on finding an exit. We should get out of here as soon as possible. This is a good level to stay in for too long.”</p> <p>“Roger that,” Kokona said in reply, using an expression I had never heard before.</p> <p>We were already beginning to move forward, and several of my Kitsune mask companions patted me reassuringly the back to prompt me forward. Still, I couldn’t help but hesitate. It took me a few moments to choke the words out, but I eventually managed.</p> <p>“W-wait,” I stammered. “I’m sure you’ve heard about me; I’m Kimiko, the kitsune. You know what that is… right?”</p> <p>I reached out to place my hand on what I thought was Lawson-san’s shoulder, but as he turned around, the candlelight glinting off the mask showed a different pattern. My cheeks flushed in embarrassment as the Bauta mask wearer analyzed me, looking me up and down. He shrugged without a word, turning to another figure who was approaching. This time, I could tell the approaching figure was Lawson-san. They exchanged a glance before Lawson-san spoke.</p> <p>“You’ve done your part already,” he said, without any indication that he knew what those words meant to me. I had done my part, alright. My part in putting everyone in jeopardy.</p> <p>“Listen. This is an enclosed, tight space. Unlike Level 2, which you just came from, these walls are flammable, and these rooms filled with all sorts of ignitable shit. Trust us when we say that we’ve got it covered. We can’t risk you burning down the entire level or something. Stay with the others, don’t get separated, and comply with the orders. That’s how you’ll stay safe. Let us handle this, it’s our job, after all.”</p> <p>“Okay…” I said, my voice trailing off. I slunk back towards the rest of the group while turning my back away from the Bauta mask group. It was then that I heard the steady thrum of thunderous footsteps, and Lawson-san shouting. I didn’t stay long enough to hear what I said. The Kistune sub-sector was already on its feet. We tumbled through room after room as the M.E.G. followed in hot pursuit. There were yells and the sound of clanging metal, and the spears and daggers the Bauta mask sub-sector used in combat instantly swam to mind. In the dark, I couldn’t see the blood splattering on worn-out shirts and dusty pants, but the stench was unavoidable. I couldn’t contain my morbid curiosity. I snapped my fingers and a tiny bluish-green ember sprang to my fingertips. I peered around its dancing figure to see heavy silhouettes writhing in the darkness like a pit of snakes.</p> <p>“What are you doing?” Sagobe-san exclaimed. “Kill it! Kill the fire; we can’t let them know where we are!”</p> <p>The light from the flame illuminated the room just enough for me to see one of the Bauta mask wearers falling to the ground with a heavy thump that was quickly covered by the violent noise of the scuffle. From behind him, a M.E.G. operative pulled out the tip of her spear. I felt my blood turn to ice, chilling the fire and snuffing it out in an instant. The world went dark again, but even then, it was spinning. Fear shot through my body like a deadly poison, and I felt bile rising up and out of my throat.</p> <p>That was already one person dead because of my hesitation. Why had I allowed the people back at Japan to elevate me and treat me like some respectable ethereal being? I was deserving of no praise. For all the power that I held at my fingertips, I was so cowardly that I would rather choose to run away and let weaker humans die in my name. For what? For me to run away again, and let the next line of my defenders fall down as corpses?</p> <p>I reached out my arm, willing the fire back into my fingertips, but it wouldn’t come. I couldn’t bear to see the dead bodies that I had created. The sounds of the battle burned themselves into my memory. On weak, shaking legs, I turned and fled once more.</p> <p>Upon turning the corner and heading through a shadowy doorway, I saw light up ahead, illuminating the people ahead of me like the sun peeking out during an eclipse. We wandered into a great library, with bookshelves as tall as two-story buildings rising like wooden skyscrapers of literature to the ceiling. A long purple carpet snaked down the hardwood floor, bisecting the library in two like the tongue of a great dragon. We shuffled single-file between the hulking walls of books, and as we moved along, I took a glance at the arrays of leatherbound spines. Each book’s title read in an unknown language, remnants of a nonexistent time period.</p> <p>Just as we reached the halfway point to the elaborate double door at the end of the library, the doorway behind us flew open. M.E.G. agents swarmed into the room, and my stomach dropped when I saw the remains of people I could have befriended plastered on their sticky clothes. I should have known they stood no chance without me. Their numbers were simply too small – only about a dozen to fifty or more M.E.G agents.</p> <p>“We don’t want to fight you,” one of the agents called out from across the room. “You didn’t have to attack us like that, but we have you outnumbered and will use force if we have to. Don’t make us do it. We need to know what you’re doing with all this valuable information, and why you’re acting so hostile to us. Who is behind all this? How many are in your organization? Answer our questions and you will remain unharmed.”</p> <p>“You’ll never catch us!” Marcus yelled, shoving his way back to stare the M.E.G. agents in their eyes. “You already know who we are. You already know what our goals are. You don’t need us to tell you, because you know deep in your cold hearts what the shit you did to us would make any person want.”</p> <p>The two M.E.G. agents on both sides of the enormous hole straightened the nozzle, and the man at the water tank twisted the valve. A frightening amount of scalding water shot at Marcus, knocking him to his feet in an instant. The M.E.G. agents turned off the hose as we gasped in panic. The bodies in front of my pressed back upon me in an effort to steer clear of the scalding water covering Marcus’ body.</p> <p>Marcus was writhing in pain, clutching his face and emitting a sound that no human or animal should ever make. The distinct smell of almonds permeated the air around us.<br /> “Cashew Water,” Sagobe-san muttered in contempt.</p> <p>“Do you want us all to die?” a voice called out from behind me. “You’re going to attract every Lurker in the fucking level with all that water!”</p> <p>Sure enough, as both groups stood facing each other, the sound of echoing footsteps coming from the left and right of us ricocheted against the dusty walls of books. A monstrous figure burst through an ancient cobweb wall, sending tendrils of white and yellow clinging to the nearest surface like frantic worms and maggots. Another one tore through the yellowed pages of books to the right and clutched at the air in front of us wildly with one of its many legs. Both the agents and the Maidens present screamed in horror as the awakened Lurkers swarmed us. The people in front of me made a desperate break for the exit, while the people behind me shoved and jostled me about trying to save themselves.</p> <p>Soon enough, I was left facing the middle of the hallway, where the space in between the agents and I was quickly filled with the terrible forms of the aggravated creatures before me. The pained face of a human, skin worn like a deflated mask over a mass of writhing flesh atop the body of a ten-legged worm. Staring me in the eyes with its soulless broken retinas.</p> <p>Marcus got to his feet, stumbling about and leaning on the bookshelves for support. He limped past me as I pushed him back. He fell to the ground and reached out his hand to grab mine, but he was already behind me and I was too focused on the Lurker ahead of me to notice.</p> <p>Every inch of my body was trembling, my breath shaky and shallow. My body was nearly petrified – but I broke the spell by clenching my fist and furrowing my brow. Self-hate turned into anger, and anger turned into fire. I grit my teeth and tore out my blue flames from the air itself. The temperature in the room rose instantly, and the Lurkers before me cowered in sudden fear.</p> <p>“Don’t be a hero, Kimiko!” Sagobe-san was saying, but I couldn’t hear her over the thrum of my superheated heartbeat. She wanted me to leave Marcus to die and run away myself. Even I wanted to leave Marcus to die and run away myself. But it was time I earned my status as a being to be respected. I had seen enough.</p> <p><em>They’re afraid of light,</em> I suddenly realized, as they reeled each time the flames pounced at their flammable worm-like bodies. <em>Well, I’ll just fill the entire room with light, then.</em></p> <p>I pressed my fingertips into the wooden frame of the bookshelf. The sparks flew instantly, leaping from my fingers as feasting on the wood. Pages and pages of unknown knowledge fell into the endless flickering jaws of my infernal beast, never to be discovered again. I heard yelps from behind the Lurkers, and knew that the M.E.G had seen the burning bookcases. I watched as the insatiable red-orange tongues tasted the flesh of the Lurkers, and winced as they emitted a high-pitched scream out of serrated mouths. Nevertheless, watching the horrific threat that jeopardized my companions only seconds earlier wither away and surrender to flame put a small glimmer of pride within my craven heart.</p> <p>Satisfied with my work, I backed away from the scene as the bookshelves began to break apart and tumble upon one another like dominoes, now that their foundation had been eaten away. I scampered to the exit, and the last things that I saw were the skeletons of the bookcases’ frames crumpling to a burning heap of paper and wood, trapping the disintegrating corpses of Lurkers and M.E.G. members alike underneath. I turned, heaved open the great exit door, and left the room.</p> <p>I felt the pride within me swell. I looked around at all the Maidens by my side as they caught their breath.</p> <p>“Are they,” Sagobe-san began between breaths. “Still chasing us? What happened to the M.E.G.? What about those Lurkers?”</p> <p>“I took care of them both,” I said with a smile. “All of them are gone now. We don’t have to worry anymore! I finally got my act together and used my powers to save people.”</p> <p>“That’s incredible,” Sagobe-san said, sharing my smile. She lifted her mask and revealed a sincere, well-worn face. With a shock, I realized that I hadn’t ever seen her smile. It was a beautiful, precious image, and I instantly wished it to never fade. “I didn’t think you had it in you. Glad to see I was wrong. I suppose we’re all here because of you, then. We would have died in that enclosed environment if you hadn’t held back the Lurkers for us.”</p> <p>“That’s… right,” I nodded. I felt a crowd gather around me, masks upon masks upon masks, all with smiling faces underneath. I looked from person to person, knowing their names and faces behind their masks. A community, people who treated me not as an object to be feared or respected from afar, but people who allowed me to be imperfect. People who would deal with my cowardice, despite disappointing their expectations of a hero. People who loved me, and people I loved back. I turned around, looking at each one with a surge of relief and affection. These people were all precious to me, more than anything I had experienced in Japan. But something was off.</p> <p>There was one person missing. One person that I had absolutely forgotten about while I was so wrapped up in being a hero.</p> <p>I whirled around in utter despair to stare at the door we had just come from as it dawned on me that I had just burned Marcus alive.</p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/little-kitsunebi-part-ii/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-20619980311185418470" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div style="text-align: center;"></div> </div> <div class="image-container"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/little-kitsunebi-part-ii/divider" width="700px" alt="divider" class="image" /></div> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>By <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/rikas-author-page|">Kitty Rika</a><br /> <strong>Lily Image:</strong> <a href="https://www.rawpixel.com/image/2618180/free-illustration-image-lotus-water-lily-flower">Lotus Water Lily Illustration</a> on RawPixel, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Public Domain</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kitty-rika" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7483564&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713139" alt="Kitty Rika" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7483564)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kitty-rika" >Kitty Rika</a></span></p>

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was it. My first ever adventure within the Masked Maidens. It&#039;s crazy how I ended up there to begin with. It all felt so fast&amp;#8230; Yeah, but this was a mission that I am very fond of. We got to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt; like the mission stated and we were heading to the M.E.G. Base Omega.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was with Janice at the time, just the two of us. I had no idea where Sully was, but he was supposed to meet us there. Level 4 felt very strange to me. Like people were supposed to be there and supposed to be doing things, but it just felt like a ghost town. It&#039;s weird how The Backrooms can make an area seem like people had been there all their lives, until they suddenly disappeared in a flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While moving towards our destination, I decided to learn more about Janice and ask about how she saw life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So&amp;#8230; Janice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I was wondering how you see the world, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well&amp;#8230; Hmm&amp;#8230; Y&#039;know, I never really thought too much of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Really? There&#039;s no like, way you really see the world? What about after the corruption has been stopped?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, besides the corruption within multiple factions&amp;#8230; I honestly don&#039;t know what I&#039;ll be doing after all of that. I guess I&#039;ve just been focusing all of my thinking on my missions. Hm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, maybe we could do things together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Mmm, maybe. We&#039;ll see how this all goes. But you&#039;re right I should&amp;#8230; think about the world with an outlook of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#039;ll help you get a hold of things if you put it all into retrospect. I personally see the world as&amp;#8230; kind of cold. At least in The Backrooms, no one really cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Aww, well, consider me as your friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ha! Thanks! That, means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you need anything, I&#039;m here for you&amp;#8230; Uhh, Kyra? Is everything alright? You&#039;re squeezing your arm a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Um&amp;#8230; yeah I just, woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; You&#039;re&amp;#8230; sure everything is oka-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;C&#039;mon! You guys gotta have something for my liking!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Aaaaaand he beat us to the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Heh, sounds like &#039;im.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Masks on. We&#039;ll talk about that later. &lt;em&gt;Time to conceal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Right&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s begin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We equipped our masks and prepared to enter Base Omega. Luckily, this mission was chosen because security had been under maintenance for a few days. I honestly don&#039;t know how a group could build something like this within something as crazy and unpredictable as The Backrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of unpredictable, Sully was there distracting the guards. We peeked over the corner to see him use his skills. He is a very efficient killer which can be very scary for our enemies. There were two guards at the entrance way holding spears. Camera systems were down currently from the maintenance. He was then trying to distract them by having the guards tell him a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Jokes aren&#039;t that hard to come up with! Just look at me! I&#039;m a joke in itself!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guards seemed to be very aggravated from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look, we&#039;re done here. If you wont leave us alone, then we will remove you by force.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started to walk towards Sullivan with the intentions on removing him, but before they could do anything Sully slowly walked up to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Okay okay okay, here! Let me show you something funny!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fuck are yo- AUGH!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walk up to one of the guards, and pulled out a switchblade from his sleeve. Punctured the guard&#039;s stomach. Stumbling over as if he tripped on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my! Sorry I think I tripped on something that was never there! HAHA!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other guard, who was a fair distance away from Sully, started to run towards him, but Sully was faster. He pulled the blade from the bleeding guard and threw it over to the other very quickly, impaling the second guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh oh, sorry I have uncontrollable reflexes! Actually I&#039;m just joking I just have bad aim, I meant to go for the head. Heheha!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He slowly turned his head in a crooked manner towards our position and then called us over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You two just gonna watch me pick my ass or do you like that sort of thing?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then walked over to the main gate. I for one, was very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That was&amp;#8230; very gruesome Sullivan. I guess I should say good job but it was all very loud. I&#039;m just hoping you didn&#039;t mess it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well I was impressed. I assure you I don&#039;t normally have skills like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shucks! You guys gave me butterflies&amp;#8230; and I gave them wings. Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s not make fun of that and move on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My bad! They are a part of the unseen corruption after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes but there has to be some sort of respe-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Can we not complain and finish this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right! Complaining is your job Kyra! I forgot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230; you&#039;re right Kyra. We need to finish this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And while you two are on your honeymoon, I&#039;ll be skipping away to the beat of my messy destruction! Cheerio!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sully then started to skip and hop away, doing the rest of his job for this mission. We needed him to distract any other guards that come our way if they get alerted by our presence. He would be patrolling the base from the outside and inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and Janice went into Base Omega. We snuck around some Operatives and took out a few guards. Janice grabbed a crowbar that one of them was holding. What we needed to do was get into the main Database Computers in Base Omega. With some Database Admin access, which Janice knew the passcode very well. I don&#039;t know how she got it but she had it. We went inside to the room ready to take some of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice told me to barricade the door while we searched through the terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Put this chair here to block the door handle, then move that cabinet in front of the door so no one gets too nosy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Time to be put to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I&#039;m gonna plug in our USB into the terminal system and download any important Entries we find. Let me plug it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The entrance has been blocked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Good. I need to focus here. I need to enter the passcode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Are you sure that no presence can view us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Got it! And yes, I am sure tha-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There was something in your ear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Janice are you alright?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What&amp;#8230;? No, no I&#039;m fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;But&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay I don&#039;t have time for that, take off the mask and look at this! I don&#039;t want that mask to start complaining about something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay.&lt;/em&gt; So&amp;#8230; Wait, this is the food shortage that we had back at Camp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hmm, seems like 6.1 is inaccesable and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-b-n-t-g&quot;&gt;the B.N.T.G.&lt;/a&gt; are having some conflict with The M.E.G.. It doesn&#039;t sound too good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems like&amp;#8230; The M.E.G. are really trying though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It still doesn&#039;t give an apology for what they did to us and many other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; True&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Now&amp;#8230; look at this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Object 24&lt;/a&gt; experiment logs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; We found more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I need to access that right away. Put in the passwo- No! Nnononono that&#039;s the alarm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You got it wrong!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;They were expecting us!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a panic. I didn&#039;t know if we would make it out or not. This was the first time I had seen Janice terrified too. They either changed the password or locked us out. But the alarm was blaring. I was scared. The Database Admins must had have changed the password, as it seems that they have had this happen to them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice, in a panic, grabbed the crowbar she found from earlier and destroyed the terminal. She smacked the thing around four times, surprisingly breaking the alarm… and her USB key along with it. She was sobbing. I didn&#039;t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked into my pockets and found my own USB Key. It was filled to the max storage limit with images of my family back home&amp;#8230; But I knew what I had to do. I deleted all of them after I plugged it in to the second terminal that survived and proceeded to download the Object 24 Experiment Logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bu- K- Kyra wasn&#039;t that your-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&amp;#8230; it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No! No you shouldn&#039;t have done that! It&#039;s the only thing you have left!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; The Maidens are what I have left. And if that is my goal I will stop at nothing to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You saved our mission&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8230; Thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; No need. Thank you! You are like a mentor to me. I thought you were&amp;#8230; perfect. That there was nothing you could mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Really? Heh&amp;#8230; nah I suck!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; No! No you don&#039;t. When we went into this mission I saw the things that made you tick. Which made me remember that we are all human. No one is perfect. But it&#039;s those imperfections that make you perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t now what to say.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; You can thank me later when we get out of this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yeah&amp;#8230; Yeah is it, complete?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few seconds aaaand&amp;#8230; done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the download was complete, I went to take it out of the terminal before Janice attempted the same thing and we touched hands. I froze, but then we quickly apologized. When we left the Database management room, I equipped my mask and we ran through a few halls in the base until we were met by Sully once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was covered in blood, with the bodies of around six guards scattered around. He seemed out of breath, but we had to leave, so we approached to tell him to follow us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;My god! Is that all blood?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nah I just got a sun tan! Now what the hell have you two been doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We were saving the mission. Come with us, we need to leave the stage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Already!? I was just getting warmed up! Hence the sun tan! Heheh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s get going. Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Okay I see. I guess I&#039;ll save round two for later like the leftovers in my fridge! Mmm, that reminded me-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Not now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we ran through Base Omega, we ended up having a few guards chase us. We ran around the corner, and I could see their shadows engulfing the light from the fluorescent lights above. There was furniture scattered around the complex. The halls themselves were somewhat tall. Sully ran up to a couch, running onto the wall then instantly jumping off, throwing three knives at the guards. All missed but one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Bullseye! However I am running low on ammo. I can&#039;t beat the high-score! Heha!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guards halted and turned around to assist the wounded guard. As we ran, another guard jumped us from a cubicle. Janice used her crowbar to crack open the guard&#039;s poorly-crafted helmet. It had slowed her down, but she was fast, so she caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We have to keep going! We&#039;re being ambushed around every corner!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Janice yelped while reaching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied with &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We must find a different exit!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ah yes! Let&#039;s pull a magic door out of thin air! That is surely something we can do!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Sully said while running with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I saw guards run up far away at the end of the hall, spears in hand. I heard a voice from the back of my mind that was not my own. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The wall&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. It must have been one of the original users of this mask. I knew there was no other way to escape alive but one. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Take a hold of my hand! I know something we can do!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I shouted while my mind was racing of what could happen to us. Janice grabbed my hand like I asked while grabbing Sullivan and pulling him closer to us. I jumped in head-first to the wall with all my might to try and do something. And it worked. I quickly No-Clipped into the wall successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Ahahahaha! Yes! Into the rabbit hole we go!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Sully shouted in laughter as he faded through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all fell face-first into the into the soft carpet flooring. I rolled over onto my back, in pain from the impact, groaning as I tried to make sense of where we were. I looked up to see a long hall that seemed to stretch on forever… doors on every side.. An ominous piano jingle played miraculously out of nowhere as I stood up. I looked back to see Janice and Sully doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oooooooh! Is this heaven!? Ah, nope! Still worse then hell!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Eaugh&amp;#8230; is this&amp;#8230; this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-287&quot;&gt;level-287&lt;/a&gt;! Kyra you did it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed I have&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; Phew, it was getting real hot under there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Tell me about it&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; So&amp;#8230; There are four ways we can leave this place through these doors. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-289&quot;&gt;Level -2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;Level 0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2&quot;&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-484&quot;&gt;level-484&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s not enter -2, I found that when I was kicked out of the pool party for being as majestic as myself. Had a lot of slender fellows scream at me. Heh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, funny. I suggest we get to Level 2 when we can, but the entrance is really dangerous and rare to find here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right! So let&#039;s spend an hour or two not doing that! I&#039;ve heard the weather is pretty nice today!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Level 0 is more common here I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Well that&#039;d be right, same with -2. The most difficult Levels to find are Level 2 and The Whiteout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I suppose we could search around for a bit right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Heh, opening miraculously random doors lead to random results. I leant that the hard way! I once had opened a door and got sucker punched right in the nozzle! And then I woke up an hour later with a sucker in my mouth! Sucker punch!&amp;#8230; Or was that a dream&amp;#8230;? To be fair I can&#039;t make up the difference between realism or fantasy, but I guess that is just the wonders of&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all heard an impact sound to our left as we saw a few M.E.G. members fall in through the walls and ceiling. &amp;quot;Look! There they are!&amp;quot; I heard one of them shout towards us. Janice opened a door that lead to Level 0. We wanted to find Level 2 but it seemed like we had no choice. We all ran towards the door in a rush. We knew we&#039;d lose each other, but the Maidens know how to find their way back, and so did I. As I hopped into it, I fell on the hard, old, and disgusting carpet of Level 0. I got up and looked behind me to see the blank wall of the yellow repetitive wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally we would all end up together, but this was Level 0, and no one can stick together in that place. You can&#039;t see, feel and hear anyone but yourself. So I equipped my mask and I made my way towards an exit, wherever it was, grasping my left arm, as it used to sting a lot once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what felt like hours&amp;#8230; a day had passed. I made it into Level 2. I could&#039;ve found the mirror in Level 0 back to &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939&quot;&gt;Level 939&lt;/a&gt; but I&#039;d be very lucky to find that on my own. As soon as I stepped in, I heard the sounds of a living creature from the corner to my right. I see it. A beautiful bird full of colorful feathers. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182&quot;&gt;Masked Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. It flew in gracefully towards me and dropped a small message into the palms of my hand as it proceeded to fly back to its home. I Opened it up to see a small ball of light fly out of it. The note itself read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Customfont&quot;&gt;Great job Kyra. You and the rest of your team did very well. Even though your team alerted The M.E.G. you all managed to survive and escape successfully with the data provided. We are all very proud and we are enthusiastic about what your team was able to gather. Fallow the small light, they&#039;re your friend. We will be sending you and the others on more missions very soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Customfont&quot;&gt;You are indeed ready to reveal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Customfont&quot;&gt;- Amanda Wright&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was so exciting for me. I felt proud of myself that I did something important! I felt like I made my team happy&amp;#8230; like Janice. I seemed to made her have a better outlook on herself. And that makes me happy because I kind of have struggles with that myself. And for Sully, he&#039;s just Sully. Really nothing can change his mood. Always carefree, skipping around happy. I&#039;m glad he enjoys his purpose with his mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the small glowing light started to fly away. Small, and glowing purple. I went to follow it. I had a feeling it would lead back to a mirror in Level 2. So I kept up with the pace. However, something&amp;#8230; bothered me the whole time. As I was walking throughout Level 2. I was thinking about our successful mission but I couldn&#039;t help thinking… something felt off. Something wasn&#039;t right&amp;#8230; I kept asking the same question over and over. It all happened so awkwardly and fast I couldn&#039;t help myself but to think&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was in her ear&amp;#8230;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					<![CDATA[
						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>May 20th, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>This was it. My first ever adventure within the Masked Maidens. It's crazy how I ended up there to begin with. It all felt so fast&#8230; Yeah, but this was a mission that I am very fond of. We got to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a> like the mission stated and we were heading to the M.E.G. Base Omega.</p> <p>I was with Janice at the time, just the two of us. I had no idea where Sully was, but he was supposed to meet us there. Level 4 felt very strange to me. Like people were supposed to be there and supposed to be doing things, but it just felt like a ghost town. It's weird how The Backrooms can make an area seem like people had been there all their lives, until they suddenly disappeared in a flash.</p> <p>While moving towards our destination, I decided to learn more about Janice and ask about how she saw life.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So&#8230; Janice?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well I was wondering how you see the world, I guess.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well&#8230; Hmm&#8230; Y'know, I never really thought too much of that.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Really? There's no like, way you really see the world? What about after the corruption has been stopped?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> I mean, besides the corruption within multiple factions&#8230; I honestly don't know what I'll be doing after all of that. I guess I've just been focusing all of my thinking on my missions. Hm.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, maybe we could do things together?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Mmm, maybe. We'll see how this all goes. But you're right I should&#8230; think about the world with an outlook of some kind.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yeah, it'll help you get a hold of things if you put it all into retrospect. I personally see the world as&#8230; kind of cold. At least in The Backrooms, no one really cares.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Aww, well, consider me as your friend!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ha! Thanks! That, means a lot.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> If you need anything, I'm here for you&#8230; Uhh, Kyra? Is everything alright? You're squeezing your arm a lot.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Um&#8230; yeah I just, woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> You're&#8230; sure everything is oka-</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>C'mon! You guys gotta have something for my liking!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Aaaaaand he beat us to the entrance.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Heh, sounds like 'im.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Masks on. We'll talk about that later. <em>Time to conceal.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Right&#8230; <em>Let's begin.</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>We equipped our masks and prepared to enter Base Omega. Luckily, this mission was chosen because security had been under maintenance for a few days. I honestly don't know how a group could build something like this within something as crazy and unpredictable as The Backrooms.</p> <p>Speaking of unpredictable, Sully was there distracting the guards. We peeked over the corner to see him use his skills. He is a very efficient killer which can be very scary for our enemies. There were two guards at the entrance way holding spears. Camera systems were down currently from the maintenance. He was then trying to distract them by having the guards tell him a joke.</p> <p><em>&quot;Jokes aren't that hard to come up with! Just look at me! I'm a joke in itself!&quot;</em></p> <p>The guards seemed to be very aggravated from this.</p> <p>&quot;Look, we're done here. If you wont leave us alone, then we will remove you by force.&quot;</p> <p>They started to walk towards Sullivan with the intentions on removing him, but before they could do anything Sully slowly walked up to them.</p> <p><em>&quot;Okay okay okay, here! Let me show you something funny!&quot;</em></p> <p>&quot;The fuck are yo- AUGH!?&quot;</p> <p>He walk up to one of the guards, and pulled out a switchblade from his sleeve. Punctured the guard's stomach. Stumbling over as if he tripped on something.</p> <p><em>&quot;Oh my! Sorry I think I tripped on something that was never there! HAHA!&quot;</em></p> <p>The other guard, who was a fair distance away from Sully, started to run towards him, but Sully was faster. He pulled the blade from the bleeding guard and threw it over to the other very quickly, impaling the second guard.</p> <p><em>&quot;Oh oh, sorry I have uncontrollable reflexes! Actually I'm just joking I just have bad aim, I meant to go for the head. Heheha!&quot;</em></p> <p>He slowly turned his head in a crooked manner towards our position and then called us over.</p> <p><em>&quot;You two just gonna watch me pick my ass or do you like that sort of thing?&quot;</em></p> <p>We then walked over to the main gate. I for one, was very impressed.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>That was&#8230; very gruesome Sullivan. I guess I should say good job but it was all very loud. I'm just hoping you didn't mess it up.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Well I was impressed. I assure you I don't normally have skills like that.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Shucks! You guys gave me butterflies&#8230; and I gave them wings. Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Let's not make fun of that and move on.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Indeed.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>My bad! They are a part of the unseen corruption after all.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Yes but there has to be some sort of respe-</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Can we not complain and finish this?</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Right! Complaining is your job Kyra! I forgot!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Sigh&#8230; you're right Kyra. We need to finish this.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>And while you two are on your honeymoon, I'll be skipping away to the beat of my messy destruction! Cheerio!</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>Sully then started to skip and hop away, doing the rest of his job for this mission. We needed him to distract any other guards that come our way if they get alerted by our presence. He would be patrolling the base from the outside and inside.</p> <p>Me and Janice went into Base Omega. We snuck around some Operatives and took out a few guards. Janice grabbed a crowbar that one of them was holding. What we needed to do was get into the main Database Computers in Base Omega. With some Database Admin access, which Janice knew the passcode very well. I don't know how she got it but she had it. We went inside to the room ready to take some of the data.</p> <p>Janice told me to barricade the door while we searched through the terminals.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Put this chair here to block the door handle, then move that cabinet in front of the door so no one gets too nosy.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Time to be put to use.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>I'm gonna plug in our USB into the terminal system and download any important Entries we find. Let me plug it in.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>The entrance has been blocked.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Good. I need to focus here. I need to enter the passcode.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Are you sure that no presence can view us?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Got it! And yes, I am sure tha-</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>There was something in your ear?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Janice are you alright?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>What&#8230;? No, no I'm fine.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>But&#8212;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Okay I don't have time for that, take off the mask and look at this! I don't want that mask to start complaining about something.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Okay.</em> So&#8230; Wait, this is the food shortage that we had back at Camp!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Hmm, seems like 6.1 is inaccesable and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-b-n-t-g">the B.N.T.G.</a> are having some conflict with The M.E.G.. It doesn't sound too good.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> It seems like&#8230; The M.E.G. are really trying though.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>It still doesn't give an apology for what they did to us and many other people.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> True&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Now&#8230; look at this. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a> experiment logs.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> We found more?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yes I need to access that right away. Put in the passwo- No! Nnononono that's the alarm!</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You got it wrong!?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>They were expecting us!</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>I was in a panic. I didn't know if we would make it out or not. This was the first time I had seen Janice terrified too. They either changed the password or locked us out. But the alarm was blaring. I was scared. The Database Admins must had have changed the password, as it seems that they have had this happen to them before.</p> <p>Janice, in a panic, grabbed the crowbar she found from earlier and destroyed the terminal. She smacked the thing around four times, surprisingly breaking the alarm… and her USB key along with it. She was sobbing. I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>I looked into my pockets and found my own USB Key. It was filled to the max storage limit with images of my family back home&#8230; But I knew what I had to do. I deleted all of them after I plugged it in to the second terminal that survived and proceeded to download the Object 24 Experiment Logs.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Bu- K- Kyra wasn't that your-</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Yes&#8230; it was.</p> <p><strong>Janice</strong> <em>No! No you shouldn't have done that! It's the only thing you have left!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> The Maidens are what I have left. And if that is my goal I will stop at nothing to complete it.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>You saved our mission&#8230; I&#8230; Thank you.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> No need. Thank you! You are like a mentor to me. I thought you were&#8230; perfect. That there was nothing you could mess up.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Really? Heh&#8230; nah I suck!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> No! No you don't. When we went into this mission I saw the things that made you tick. Which made me remember that we are all human. No one is perfect. But it's those imperfections that make you perfect.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>I&#8230; I don't now what to say.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> You can thank me later when we get out of this mess.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Yeah&#8230; Yeah is it, complete?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Just a few seconds aaaand&#8230; done!</p> </div> <hr /> <p>Once the download was complete, I went to take it out of the terminal before Janice attempted the same thing and we touched hands. I froze, but then we quickly apologized. When we left the Database management room, I equipped my mask and we ran through a few halls in the base until we were met by Sully once more.</p> <p>He was covered in blood, with the bodies of around six guards scattered around. He seemed out of breath, but we had to leave, so we approached to tell him to follow us.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>My god! Is that all blood?</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Nah I just got a sun tan! Now what the hell have you two been doing?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>We were saving the mission. Come with us, we need to leave the stage.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Already!? I was just getting warmed up! Hence the sun tan! Heheh.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Let's get going. Now.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Okay I see. I guess I'll save round two for later like the leftovers in my fridge! Mmm, that reminded me-</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Not now!</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>As we ran through Base Omega, we ended up having a few guards chase us. We ran around the corner, and I could see their shadows engulfing the light from the fluorescent lights above. There was furniture scattered around the complex. The halls themselves were somewhat tall. Sully ran up to a couch, running onto the wall then instantly jumping off, throwing three knives at the guards. All missed but one.</p> <p><em>&quot;Bullseye! However I am running low on ammo. I can't beat the high-score! Heha!&quot;</em></p> <p>One of the guards halted and turned around to assist the wounded guard. As we ran, another guard jumped us from a cubicle. Janice used her crowbar to crack open the guard's poorly-crafted helmet. It had slowed her down, but she was fast, so she caught up.</p> <p><em>&quot;We have to keep going! We're being ambushed around every corner!&quot;</em> Janice yelped while reaching us.</p> <p>I replied with <em>&quot;We must find a different exit!&quot;</em></p> <p><em>&quot;Ah yes! Let's pull a magic door out of thin air! That is surely something we can do!&quot;</em> Sully said while running with us.</p> <p>As I saw guards run up far away at the end of the hall, spears in hand. I heard a voice from the back of my mind that was not my own. <em>&quot;The wall&#8230;&quot;</em>. It must have been one of the original users of this mask. I knew there was no other way to escape alive but one. <em>&quot;Take a hold of my hand! I know something we can do!&quot;</em> I shouted while my mind was racing of what could happen to us. Janice grabbed my hand like I asked while grabbing Sullivan and pulling him closer to us. I jumped in head-first to the wall with all my might to try and do something. And it worked. I quickly No-Clipped into the wall successfully.</p> <p><em>&quot;Ahahahaha! Yes! Into the rabbit hole we go!&quot;</em> Sully shouted in laughter as he faded through the wall.</p> <p>We all fell face-first into the into the soft carpet flooring. I rolled over onto my back, in pain from the impact, groaning as I tried to make sense of where we were. I looked up to see a long hall that seemed to stretch on forever… doors on every side.. An ominous piano jingle played miraculously out of nowhere as I stood up. I looked back to see Janice and Sully doing the same.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Oooooooh! Is this heaven!? Ah, nope! Still worse then hell!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Eaugh&#8230; is this&#8230; this is <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-287">level-287</a>! Kyra you did it!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Indeed I have&#8230;</em> Phew, it was getting real hot under there.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Tell me about it&#8230;</em> So&#8230; There are four ways we can leave this place through these doors. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-289">Level -2</a>, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">Level 0</a>, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2">Level 2</a> and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-484">level-484</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Let's not enter -2, I found that when I was kicked out of the pool party for being as majestic as myself. Had a lot of slender fellows scream at me. Heh&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Sure, funny. I suggest we get to Level 2 when we can, but the entrance is really dangerous and rare to find here…</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Right! So let's spend an hour or two not doing that! I've heard the weather is pretty nice today!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Level 0 is more common here I guess?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Well that'd be right, same with -2. The most difficult Levels to find are Level 2 and The Whiteout.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well I suppose we could search around for a bit right?</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Heh, opening miraculously random doors lead to random results. I leant that the hard way! I once had opened a door and got sucker punched right in the nozzle! And then I woke up an hour later with a sucker in my mouth! Sucker punch!&#8230; Or was that a dream&#8230;? To be fair I can't make up the difference between realism or fantasy, but I guess that is just the wonders of&#8212;</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>We all heard an impact sound to our left as we saw a few M.E.G. members fall in through the walls and ceiling. &quot;Look! There they are!&quot; I heard one of them shout towards us. Janice opened a door that lead to Level 0. We wanted to find Level 2 but it seemed like we had no choice. We all ran towards the door in a rush. We knew we'd lose each other, but the Maidens know how to find their way back, and so did I. As I hopped into it, I fell on the hard, old, and disgusting carpet of Level 0. I got up and looked behind me to see the blank wall of the yellow repetitive wallpaper.</p> <p>Normally we would all end up together, but this was Level 0, and no one can stick together in that place. You can't see, feel and hear anyone but yourself. So I equipped my mask and I made my way towards an exit, wherever it was, grasping my left arm, as it used to sting a lot once in a while.</p> <p>After what felt like hours&#8230; a day had passed. I made it into Level 2. I could've found the mirror in Level 0 back to <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939">Level 939</a> but I'd be very lucky to find that on my own. As soon as I stepped in, I heard the sounds of a living creature from the corner to my right. I see it. A beautiful bird full of colorful feathers. It was a <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182">Masked Messenger</a>. It flew in gracefully towards me and dropped a small message into the palms of my hand as it proceeded to fly back to its home. I Opened it up to see a small ball of light fly out of it. The note itself read as follows:</p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div class="borderblock"> <p><span class="Customfont">Great job Kyra. You and the rest of your team did very well. Even though your team alerted The M.E.G. you all managed to survive and escape successfully with the data provided. We are all very proud and we are enthusiastic about what your team was able to gather. Fallow the small light, they're your friend. We will be sending you and the others on more missions very soon.</span></p> <p><span class="Customfont">You are indeed ready to reveal.</span><br /> <span class="Customfont">- Amanda Wright</span></p> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>This was so exciting for me. I felt proud of myself that I did something important! I felt like I made my team happy&#8230; like Janice. I seemed to made her have a better outlook on herself. And that makes me happy because I kind of have struggles with that myself. And for Sully, he's just Sully. Really nothing can change his mood. Always carefree, skipping around happy. I'm glad he enjoys his purpose with his mask.</p> <p>Well, the small glowing light started to fly away. Small, and glowing purple. I went to follow it. I had a feeling it would lead back to a mirror in Level 2. So I kept up with the pace. However, something&#8230; bothered me the whole time. As I was walking throughout Level 2. I was thinking about our successful mission but I couldn't help thinking… something felt off. Something wasn't right&#8230; I kept asking the same question over and over. It all happened so awkwardly and fast I couldn't help myself but to think&#8230;</p> <p><strong>What was in her ear&#8230;?</strong></p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>The original author of this entry is <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713140" alt="Stretchsterz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" >Stretchsterz</a></span></p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <th colspan="2">Other Pages By This Author</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Levels</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-289">Level 289</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-287">Level 287</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Terror Hotel</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">The Snackrooms</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-8">Cave System</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-9">The Suburbs</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">The Infinite City</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-12">Matrix</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-36-1">The Plane</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-40">Roller Rockin' Pizza!</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-43">WaterWorld</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-53">Alone</a> | [<a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-54">Stairwell of Spirals</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-64">The Lurking Darkness</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-66">Swampy Waters</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-71">Void Basement</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-81">Zoological Office</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-92">Crimson Glow</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-94">Motion</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-386">Twisted Halls</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-924">The Nuclear Family</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-293">Alpha</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-286">Level 286</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-serpents-void">The Serpents Void</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-hub">The Hub</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:joke-level-420">Level 420 (Joke)</a> | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/joke-level-fridge">Level Fridge (Joke)</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Rooms</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Traders-Vault">Traders Vault</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-surveillance-room">The Surveillance Room</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Entitles</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3">Smilers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6">Dullers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-15">Wretches</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-31">Camo Crawlers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-32">The Animations</a> | <strong><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-33">THE KING</a></strong> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-48">Aiden</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-54">Scrappers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-63">The Mangled</a>] | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-75">Wranglers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-76">What the hell is this?</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-77">The Dreamweaver</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-85">Paralies</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-167">The Party Hosts</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Objects</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>GOIs</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-B.N.T.G.">The B.N.T.G.</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>POIs</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Tales</th> <td><a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/m-e-g-the-discovery-of-the-wretch">M.E.G.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bluebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;To All Maidens:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have asked me where the mirror in &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939&quot;&gt;Level 939&lt;/a&gt; labelled &amp;quot;Level 204.1&amp;quot; leads, and why it is permanently blocked off. I do not despair at these observations &amp;#8212; in fact, I am enthralled by them, seeing such curious and explorative minds in action. It has since hurt me to turn away your inquiries with vague answers that dance around the truth, but now I have decided to trust you all with this sensitive information so that you may understand more about what goes on in the more discreet areas of management. After all, this organization is based on transparency and trust, the safety that none of us here will ever betray each other the way many of us have been betrayed. Thus, I present you with a document detailing Level 204.1 and its purpose and importance within the Masked Maidens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:mmoffset-1/HolmesSig&quot; style=&quot;width:55px;&quot; alt=&quot;HolmesSig&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;br /&gt;
Evangeline Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrance to Level 204.1 in Level 204.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overview:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 204.1 is a Sub-section of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204&quot;&gt;Level 204&lt;/a&gt;, and the only known one as well. Among Sub-sections, Level 204.1 is unique in that an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24&quot;&gt;Object 24&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely necessary for entry. Because of this, the Sub-section remains completely undiscovered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g&quot;&gt;the M.E.G.,&lt;/a&gt; and we Masked Maidens are presumably the only people alive who are currently aware of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrance to level 204.1 is located at the base of Hazard Mountain in Level 204, in the cultivation zone. It can be found on the interior side of the circular river that surrounds the mountain. As the terrain begins to slope upwards, various strata of rock are exposed in places, revealing an elaborately carved tunnel entryway in the shape of a face. The eyes of said face have been reported to move and stare intensely at any passersby. While several M.E.G. volunteers have discovered such an entrance, none of them are able to enter the cave, as they have reported that the vigilant gaze of this carved visage paralyzes all who attempt to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the mirror in Level 939 that is labelled Level 204.1 will lead you straight to the entryway. However, usage of this mirror is prohibited because of the contents of the cave that the sub-section is comprised of. Level 204.1 is an ancient catacomb, built by the same archaic society that crafted the now-ruined temples strewn about the landscape of Level 204. The masks that we use ourselves were ubiquitous among the members of this ancient civilization, and thus saw everyday normalized use. Imbued with power unrivalled by the iterations we possess, these masks and their people lived in perfect synchronization &amp;#8212; two halves of a whole. When a member of this society passed, their fragile bodies were prone to decomposition, and so this society had to engineer an alternative, more permanent way for each person&#039;s mask to follow their late wearer into the afterlife. Thus, the catacombs were constructed, with uncountable numbers of life-size stone statues in the likenesses of these deceased members, all wearing their masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-255842841691165909&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;html-block-iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-left&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask6&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-caption&quot; style=&quot;width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masked statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking to yourself, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Why, with so many powerful masks in such an easily accessible and secret place, why don&#039;t we take these masks and use them regularly?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; The answer to this question is very simple: The catacombs are guarded with various safety measures that make exploring and procuring masks from this area extremely hazardous. Thus, access to this Sub-section is strictly available to those who have proven themselves to be not only incredibly mentally resilient but outstandingly synchronized with their masks alongside with possessing great physical impetus. The masks of various sub-sector leaders were retrieved from this Sub-section, which is why many of them exhibit much more potent powers than average. The number of people who are able to overcome this challenge is few and far between, and several of our organization have been lost to the promise of power. If you so desire to brave the catacombs and take a mask of your own, you are only to do so with express permission from me. Anyone caught trying to enter without authorization will be strictly and severely punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Structure of the Catacombs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the main entryway, a long, winding set of stone stairs leads down into the catacombs. The catacombs as a whole are spread out across five different levels excavated into the soil. From the stairway, a main corridor leads onwards into the darkness for an unmeasurable distance. The main corridor of each level is intersected by several smaller branching passageways which lead deeper into the catacombs. The pattern of corridors in the catacombs can be likened to a tree, and at the end of every corridor is a small room housing ten to upwards of a thousand standing stone statues arranged together in rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small enclaves are carved into the packed soil of the walls, housing ancient braziers embedded in the earth. While in ancient times, these braziers would have lit the corridors and provided a dim glowing pathway for the spirits of the masks and their wearers to abscond from this labyrinthian structure, today they are all but burned out completely. The only light present in these otherwise obnubilated ruins comes from the several &lt;em&gt;lucernaria,&lt;/em&gt; or small surface apertures, from which the natural sunlight slithers down in small beams from holes on the ceilings and floors, cascading down from level to level. As a result, the first level of the catacombs is consequentially the most thoroughly illuminated, whilst the final fifth layer is nearly shrouded in abject darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catacombs are dry and dusty, and travel in the lower levels can become increasingly perilous due to the amount of stray sediment polluting the air. Navigation here is exceedingly difficult without a proper mask and artificial lighting. The temperature in the upper levels ranges from temperate to cool, while the lower levels are uncomfortably cold. Inside the statue-housing rooms, the temperature is significantly higher, but in no point in the catacombs is the temperature unbearably hot or cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Ancient Statues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the rooms in the catacombs is filled with ancient statues carved out of marble and limestone. While they are estimated to be over four hundred years old, many of them are in very solid condition. There has never been a reported sighting a statue that has crumbled or collapsed due to natural causes. However, about a third of the statues found in the catacombs have indeed been reduced to piles of rubble. Why is this, you may ask? The reason is due to the masks that adorn each of the statues&#039; stone visages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statues were crafted by the ancient society that dwelled in Level 204 in the shape of deceased person that wore that statue&#039;s mask. The reason for this is thought to be that the act of planting the mask on a stone likeness of a person, preserved in an underground catacomb, would be much more sustainable than planting it on the actual corpse of that person, which would eventually decay and leave the mask without a face. This way, a mask can remain connected to the wearer&#039;s face through the stone, even in the afterlife. As the connection between mask and the stone is the only thing linking the spirit of the lost individual to said mask, removing the mask from the statue will cause it to instantly collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the fact that these ancient masks are still connected to the spirits of their wearers, in addition to them being sentient in some way, removing a mask becomes very dangerous. Every mask in the catacombs is actively hostile towards members of the Masked Maidens and resists attempts to remove them from their statues. Applying too much force or using a tool such as a pickaxe causes both the mask and statue to destroy themselves. Trying to retrieve the mask gently never ends well, either. Without being assertive and confident, the mask will begin to take control of the Maiden instead and enact harm upon the wearer&#039;s body in self-defense. These masks are incredibly potent, and thus the &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; of the masks is much stronger than that of our own, and they are not to be underestimated or taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;scp-image-block block-right&quot; style=&quot;width:325px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask8&quot; style=&quot;width:325px;&quot; alt=&quot;Missing alt text.&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collected fragments of several statues&#039; bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statues themselves range from five to twelve feet (1.5 to 3.6 meters) tall on average, with realistic proportions and painted clothes. The paint has since worn off, leaving most of the statues completely grey. All of them take the form of adults. While many of them are impossibly tall for humans, it is thought that these statues are exact replicas of the lost members of the ancient society, given that the masks that would fit the deceased wearer are also perfectly molded to the statues&#039; faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statues are always arranged in rows in the center of the room, and every instance of these statues holds the same position: a tall, straight posture with both arms at the sides, palms open and feet together. The clothes range from elaborate to simple, and it appears that people from all walks of life were placed equally among each other in these rows. The amount of statues in each row, as well as the number of rows themselves, vary depending on the size of the room. Each statue is situated on a small pedestal, rising about one foot off the ground. Coming in contact with the pedestal will cause the nearby mask of that pedestal&#039;s statue to awaken and become aware of your presence. From there, it will most likely begin to exert a sort of invisible pressure on you to expel you away from it. Once again, and I cannot stress this enough, &lt;em&gt;do not go looking for these masks&lt;/em&gt;, for even if you manage to secure one, it will continue to torment you to the best of its ability for stealing it away from its previous wearer. This entire article is only to clear up confusion and questions as to why this Sub-section remains prohibited, not to encourage you to test your luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Obsidian Guardians:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the corners of each of the statue rooms are four Obsidian Guardians. The Obsidian Guardians are unique statues made out of an unknown black mineral, likened to obsidian. They vaguely resemble humanoids, but are much more similar in shape to a chess piece &amp;#8212; namely, a rook. They are faceless and bear no masks, and are approximately fifteen feet (4.5 meters) tall. Because of their towering height, many of the ceilings of the statue rooms are raised to accommodate them. When anyone enters the statue rooms, the Obsidian Guardians will remain still and silent in their corners of the room. The instant that one touches a mask that belongs to one of the statues, however, the Obsidian Guardians will spring to life, sliding across the floor at alarming speeds. Upon coming in contact with a statue, the Obsidian Guardians will smash through them, obliterating both any statues and masks that stand in between an intruder and itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Guardians will attempt to ram into intruders at high speeds, and move with enough force to have the equivalent impetus of a semi-truck driving at over 60mph. Needless to say, colliding with an Obsidian Guardian is lethal. As a result of many failed attempts to retrieve these masks, several of the statue rooms have four Obsidian Guardians resting in their corners around piles of rubble. These statue rooms have had all their statues decimated, and their remains lay strewn about with the skeletons of those with the misfortune of being unable to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entering and Exiting the Level:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catacombs have one constant and distinct entry point, which also doubles as the exit point. The aforementioned doorway in the shape of a stone face is the only known way to currently exit and enter the level. Attempts have been made to no-clip in and out of the catacombs, but they have all been unsuccessful. The doorway is located on the first level of the catacombs, in the north side of the structure, above an ascending staircase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before, entry is only possible into the level if one is currently donning a mask. The mask will ask as a cover against the petrifying glare of the stone face&#039;s eyes. Regardless, whether or not you are in possession of a mask, this Sub-section is not to be entered, both for the preservation of these ancient relics, and your own safety.&lt;/p&gt;

						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <div class="bluebox"> <h1><span>To All Maidens:</span></h1> <p>Many have asked me where the mirror in <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939">Level 939</a> labelled &quot;Level 204.1&quot; leads, and why it is permanently blocked off. I do not despair at these observations &#8212; in fact, I am enthralled by them, seeing such curious and explorative minds in action. It has since hurt me to turn away your inquiries with vague answers that dance around the truth, but now I have decided to trust you all with this sensitive information so that you may understand more about what goes on in the more discreet areas of management. After all, this organization is based on transparency and trust, the safety that none of us here will ever betray each other the way many of us have been betrayed. Thus, I present you with a document detailing Level 204.1 and its purpose and importance within the Masked Maidens.</p> <div class="image-container alignright"><img src="http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:mmoffset-1/HolmesSig" style="width:55px;" alt="HolmesSig" class="image" /></div> <div style="text-align: right;"> <p>Yours truly,<br /> Evangeline Holmes.</p> </div> </div> <hr /> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-1752222042869836568" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:325px;"><img src="https://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/level-204-1/Cave" style="width:325px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:325px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Entrance to Level 204.1 in Level 204.</p> </div> </div> <h1><span>Overview:</span></h1> <p>Level 204.1 is a Sub-section of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204">Level 204</a>, and the only known one as well. Among Sub-sections, Level 204.1 is unique in that an instance of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24">Object 24</a> is absolutely necessary for entry. Because of this, the Sub-section remains completely undiscovered by <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">the M.E.G.,</a> and we Masked Maidens are presumably the only people alive who are currently aware of its existence.</p> <p>The entrance to level 204.1 is located at the base of Hazard Mountain in Level 204, in the cultivation zone. It can be found on the interior side of the circular river that surrounds the mountain. As the terrain begins to slope upwards, various strata of rock are exposed in places, revealing an elaborately carved tunnel entryway in the shape of a face. The eyes of said face have been reported to move and stare intensely at any passersby. While several M.E.G. volunteers have discovered such an entrance, none of them are able to enter the cave, as they have reported that the vigilant gaze of this carved visage paralyzes all who attempt to do so.</p> <p>Utilizing the mirror in Level 939 that is labelled Level 204.1 will lead you straight to the entryway. However, usage of this mirror is prohibited because of the contents of the cave that the sub-section is comprised of. Level 204.1 is an ancient catacomb, built by the same archaic society that crafted the now-ruined temples strewn about the landscape of Level 204. The masks that we use ourselves were ubiquitous among the members of this ancient civilization, and thus saw everyday normalized use. Imbued with power unrivalled by the iterations we possess, these masks and their people lived in perfect synchronization &#8212; two halves of a whole. When a member of this society passed, their fragile bodies were prone to decomposition, and so this society had to engineer an alternative, more permanent way for each person's mask to follow their late wearer into the afterlife. Thus, the catacombs were constructed, with uncountable numbers of life-size stone statues in the likenesses of these deceased members, all wearing their masks.</p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-6689071991061983728" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="scp-image-block block-left" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask6" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Masked statue.</p> </div> </div> <p>You might be thinking to yourself, &quot;<em>Why, with so many powerful masks in such an easily accessible and secret place, why don't we take these masks and use them regularly?</em>&quot; The answer to this question is very simple: The catacombs are guarded with various safety measures that make exploring and procuring masks from this area extremely hazardous. Thus, access to this Sub-section is strictly available to those who have proven themselves to be not only incredibly mentally resilient but outstandingly synchronized with their masks alongside with possessing great physical impetus. The masks of various sub-sector leaders were retrieved from this Sub-section, which is why many of them exhibit much more potent powers than average. The number of people who are able to overcome this challenge is few and far between, and several of our organization have been lost to the promise of power. If you so desire to brave the catacombs and take a mask of your own, you are only to do so with express permission from me. Anyone caught trying to enter without authorization will be strictly and severely punished.</p> <hr /> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/41451d3cec368c8b59e38971473b5dfdb9a52d3f-1638303525321665889" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="styled-quote poi-link"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h1><span>To Mask is to Reveal</span></h1> </div> <div class="darkblock poi-desc"> <div class="lightblock"> <div class="image-container floatleft"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask3" width="185px" alt="mask3" class="image" /></div> <div class="image-container floatright"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask4" width="185px" alt="mask4" class="image" /></div> <div class="image-container"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask5" width="185px" alt="mask5" class="image" /></div> </div> </div> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/41451d3cec368c8b59e38971473b5dfdb9a52d3f-19937694711552817908" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:300px;"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask9" style="width:300px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:300px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Corridor in the first level of the catacombs.</p> </div> </div> <div class="image-container"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask7" width="700px" alt="mask7" class="image" /></div> <hr /> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-204-1/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-150708435980295380" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <h1><span>The Structure of the Catacombs:</span></h1> <p>From the main entryway, a long, winding set of stone stairs leads down into the catacombs. The catacombs as a whole are spread out across five different levels excavated into the soil. From the stairway, a main corridor leads onwards into the darkness for an unmeasurable distance. The main corridor of each level is intersected by several smaller branching passageways which lead deeper into the catacombs. The pattern of corridors in the catacombs can be likened to a tree, and at the end of every corridor is a small room housing ten to upwards of a thousand standing stone statues arranged together in rows.</p> <p>Small enclaves are carved into the packed soil of the walls, housing ancient braziers embedded in the earth. While in ancient times, these braziers would have lit the corridors and provided a dim glowing pathway for the spirits of the masks and their wearers to abscond from this labyrinthian structure, today they are all but burned out completely. The only light present in these otherwise obnubilated ruins comes from the several <em>lucernaria,</em> or small surface apertures, from which the natural sunlight slithers down in small beams from holes on the ceilings and floors, cascading down from level to level. As a result, the first level of the catacombs is consequentially the most thoroughly illuminated, whilst the final fifth layer is nearly shrouded in abject darkness.</p> <p>The catacombs are dry and dusty, and travel in the lower levels can become increasingly perilous due to the amount of stray sediment polluting the air. Navigation here is exceedingly difficult without a proper mask and artificial lighting. The temperature in the upper levels ranges from temperate to cool, while the lower levels are uncomfortably cold. Inside the statue-housing rooms, the temperature is significantly higher, but in no point in the catacombs is the temperature unbearably hot or cold.</p> <h1><span>The Ancient Statues:</span></h1> <p>Each of the rooms in the catacombs is filled with ancient statues carved out of marble and limestone. While they are estimated to be over four hundred years old, many of them are in very solid condition. There has never been a reported sighting a statue that has crumbled or collapsed due to natural causes. However, about a third of the statues found in the catacombs have indeed been reduced to piles of rubble. Why is this, you may ask? The reason is due to the masks that adorn each of the statues' stone visages.</p> <p>The statues were crafted by the ancient society that dwelled in Level 204 in the shape of deceased person that wore that statue's mask. The reason for this is thought to be that the act of planting the mask on a stone likeness of a person, preserved in an underground catacomb, would be much more sustainable than planting it on the actual corpse of that person, which would eventually decay and leave the mask without a face. This way, a mask can remain connected to the wearer's face through the stone, even in the afterlife. As the connection between mask and the stone is the only thing linking the spirit of the lost individual to said mask, removing the mask from the statue will cause it to instantly collapse.</p> <p>Because of the fact that these ancient masks are still connected to the spirits of their wearers, in addition to them being sentient in some way, removing a mask becomes very dangerous. Every mask in the catacombs is actively hostile towards members of the Masked Maidens and resists attempts to remove them from their statues. Applying too much force or using a tool such as a pickaxe causes both the mask and statue to destroy themselves. Trying to retrieve the mask gently never ends well, either. Without being assertive and confident, the mask will begin to take control of the Maiden instead and enact harm upon the wearer's body in self-defense. These masks are incredibly potent, and thus the &quot;will&quot; of the masks is much stronger than that of our own, and they are not to be underestimated or taken lightly.</p> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:325px;"><img src="http://liminaldoctor.wdfiles.com/local--files/gallery/mask8" style="width:325px;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:325px; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Collected fragments of several statues' bases.</p> </div> </div> <p>The statues themselves range from five to twelve feet (1.5 to 3.6 meters) tall on average, with realistic proportions and painted clothes. The paint has since worn off, leaving most of the statues completely grey. All of them take the form of adults. While many of them are impossibly tall for humans, it is thought that these statues are exact replicas of the lost members of the ancient society, given that the masks that would fit the deceased wearer are also perfectly molded to the statues' faces.</p> <p>The statues are always arranged in rows in the center of the room, and every instance of these statues holds the same position: a tall, straight posture with both arms at the sides, palms open and feet together. The clothes range from elaborate to simple, and it appears that people from all walks of life were placed equally among each other in these rows. The amount of statues in each row, as well as the number of rows themselves, vary depending on the size of the room. Each statue is situated on a small pedestal, rising about one foot off the ground. Coming in contact with the pedestal will cause the nearby mask of that pedestal's statue to awaken and become aware of your presence. From there, it will most likely begin to exert a sort of invisible pressure on you to expel you away from it. Once again, and I cannot stress this enough, <em>do not go looking for these masks</em>, for even if you manage to secure one, it will continue to torment you to the best of its ability for stealing it away from its previous wearer. This entire article is only to clear up confusion and questions as to why this Sub-section remains prohibited, not to encourage you to test your luck.</p> <h1><span>The Obsidian Guardians:</span></h1> <p>At the corners of each of the statue rooms are four Obsidian Guardians.

				<title>The Snake Crawls Part 2: Let The Chaos Ensue</title>

				<description>


&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 19th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what felt like eons of living in a prison for the innocent, I finally feel like my life is finally getting somewhere better. With the mask I feel like I am home again. Without it, I feel like I am trapped within my own mind. That I am within the flow of my own thoughts, blocked by a locked door without the key. The mask is the key; &lt;em&gt;I am finally free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s carry on the show, shall we?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To someone who tried their entire life to escape the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0&quot;&gt;yellow halls&lt;/a&gt;, the cold concrete floors of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/a&gt; would feel like a shallow grave of a reward. But that&#039;s what this world is, a purgatory. And from what we&#039;ve learned&amp;#8230; home isn&#039;t so different after all. Living your entire life to get nothing but a hollow prize that never truly existed. Let&#039;s see if we can find any differences together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were traversing through the stone cold halls. Us, and the others. Sullivan is an interesting character. He never wants to take his mask off. It seems like he never will or possibly never even could, but how can we blame him? I wouldn&#039;t want to be taken off either. We are perfect for each other. Janice is&amp;#8230; different from what we have seen&amp;#8230; It almost feels like a warm welcome after everything we have been through. Such a pity that we both ended up in this situation after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&#039;s when she started to ask questions while I was away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So&amp;#8230; Janice right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, what might it be Kyra?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; I was just thinking about my mask&amp;#8230; it considered us to be the same, but it feels different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, why would you be any different from your true self if it is yourself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; To be precise, a mask is somewhat sentient when you use it. It will then consider you and itself as the same being. Such as the reason why it goes by your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s just like, different&amp;#8230; but it feels the same way as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#039;s seen all your memories and it feels like it was a part of them. It feels the same pain as you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It must be the reason why I feel like everything is hilariously painful!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow&amp;#8230; So, you two have different masks. Do they hold different effects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, even carry different personalities&amp;#8230; but it&#039;s almost like portraying your true self. My mask is a Pantalone Mask. It can make me seem.. off sometimes, but it pretty much keeps the way I act normally. Sully&#039;s mask is&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;An entire can of worms that has already been opened by a fairly amusing jester! Heheha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; always interrupting me&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I mean, who would wanna keep me quiet? Heh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Right&amp;#8230; his mask is an Arlecchino Mask. The mask bases its entire thing off of comedy that is practically nonsense. He almost never takes it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No need to turn the lights off in this wonderous showcase of amusement! Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Ooh&amp;#8230; What would my mask be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Your mask is a Buskin Mask, otherwise known as a Tragedy Mask, popular in Greek theaters. Your mask makes you act a bit more impatient and very dramatic. You&#039;ll probably complain quite a bit using it. No offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Nah! This is all very interesting to me!&amp;#8230; I feel a lot better then I normally was back in Camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Your group is under a constant hold by The M.E.G. who are fairly corrupt in their goals. Sullivan can tell you if he&#039;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;When innocent mysteries stay unknown amongst the overlords they use the innocent for their overlooked research! It&#039;s all a hoax! A ruse to so that they can keep themselves safe. I was super lucky to be a part of that agonizing process! But that is how I met myself! On a date of destiny! Heheha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; So you&#039;re telling me they did experiments on you with the mask and you escaped with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup! He&#039;s been through a lot for how carefree he acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Personality is in the jeans! Too bad I am using a different pair of pants. Hehe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; And what&#039;s your plan here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; To stop the spread of that corruption. And put an end to their control. We will give the other groups the same treatment if they try to rise after the conflict ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A silent war, which isn&#039;t silent anymore because we just talked about it! Hmm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow, that&#039;s very admirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you Kyra. I admire your enthusiasm to help us in our quest. Now, we shall continue to reach our destination. The Madam needs to greet us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amazing, it really is. I just couldn&#039;t believe that I feel like I have a purpose in something. It&#039;s something I dreamt of every day in The Backrooms. I feel like I fit in somewhere with the rest of the puzzle. It&#039;s a very comforting feeling knowing that you matter in something for once. If this is my true purpose, then I will fulfil that mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then continued walking down the damp halls of Level 1, looking for something that was unknown to me at the time. I didn&#039;t know where I was going with them, but I knew that I&#039;d be better off there then where I was before. We saw a few Entities in the distance, but we never confronted one; we didn&#039;t need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about the cold of Level 1 really made me feel a lot better then in Level 0; still damp, but it wasn&#039;t warm. It was actually soothing and kind of refreshing. Usually I tried not to slip on the countless puddles of water on the floor. It&#039;s a strange thought to think that someone&#039;s fate may have been sealed by a puddle in this Level. Maybe while being chased? Most likely&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn&amp;#8230; when did I get so dark with my thoughts? Well, I guess I was always dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a long walk, we finally found it. Glimmering in the distance was a beautiful golden mirror. The gold itself looked real and was carved with a floral design. It was expertly crafted. And as I walked closer to it, the more it seemed to glow. It was all foggy inside, its contents left to my imagination &amp;#8212; and my curiosity. I wanted to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Woah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; Get your masks&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;it&#039;s showtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; Right&amp;#8230; Here we go&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;The spotlight has shined down on me once more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;One foot after the other! Baby steps! Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Remember Sully, we can&#039;t mess around in The Reflection. It is a fragile place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of course! Can&#039;t go around breaking the mirrors. I don&#039;t need more bad luck than what I already have! Haheh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I assume we have our audience waiting on the other side?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mhm! you&#039;re right. They&#039;ll be happy to see you Kyra. A new member is always welcomed here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gotta treat &#039;em the way you wanna be treated! I guess I just want to be in pain!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;When we walk into this mirror, we&#039;ll be transported to&amp;#8230; well, you may know it as &lt;a class=&quot;newpage&quot; href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939&quot;&gt;Level 939&lt;/a&gt;. A hall of mirrors that may take us to wherever we need to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It sounds fairly intriguing&amp;#8230; where must we go from there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Simply using the exit will lead back home. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294&quot;&gt;Level 294&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Informance is your performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, indeed it is. Let&#039;s not waste anymore time and get into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Through the curtain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we walked in we were greeted by a large hall that looked to be in medieval origin. There were many mirrors all lined up on each side of the hall. Each mirror was labeled with a number. We came out of a mirror labeled &amp;quot;Level 1&amp;quot;. It seemed to be in random order, which was weird to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was honestly amazed by that place. Just the ability to travel anywhere in a few seconds is pretty powerful. I was just wondering about how it was discovered and what possibilities this gives us. As we continued down the hall I could see a bunch of other masked members, but some of them looked&amp;#8230; off. Hazy and foggy is the only way I could put it. That was until I walked up to one. It was me! But, like a ghost. Janice explained that this was a normal effect in Level 939 and told me not to interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious, but I stopped myself and continued on forward. Then, when we reached the Entrance to Level μ we had reached a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-1 &amp;quot;Bauta&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hey! Stay back!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oooohohhohh! Spicy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-2 &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sorry for my friend here, but you guys can&#039;t enter Level μ at the moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ohh, why would that be?&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM Member-2 &amp;quot;Pantalone&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, the area is currently being searched for an M.E.G. spy. The Madam had sent a search group inside and we can&#039;t let any of them leave just yet until they are found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right. There&#039;s a mouse in your home and you don&#039;t have any traps left to catch it. So you send a bunch of cats to eat it up! Heh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;So I can see we cannot enter such place currently until this spy is caught in their act.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Seems about right. We can head somewhere else for the time being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;On the road again my friends! Let&#039;s stop for some ice cream! Heha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You know, that reminded me&amp;#8230; We can head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67&quot;&gt;Level 67&lt;/a&gt;! Up for baked goods anyone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Looks like we&#039;ll be getting somewhere after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we head over to the mirror that was labeled &amp;quot;Station 2: Level 67&amp;quot;. I thought to myself, &#039;baked goods?&#039; I wondered what they meant by that until I saw for myself. It was a bakery. It looked pretty retro, which I thought was cool. The place had a purple accent to it. It was neat!&amp;#8230; however Sully mentioned how it was colored orange so I thought it might just be an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice mentioned to behave at The Waiting Line. There were &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9&quot;&gt;Facelings&lt;/a&gt; stretching on for quite a bit&amp;#8230; I tried to be patient, but all I had in my mind were complaints. She told me that the Facelings would turn on us if we tried to cut through. I was hesitant but I waited. Once we finally got to the counter, there was another Faceling there posing as a clerk. He pointed at all the baked goods and even showed me a cinnamon roll. Those were my favorite back when I was a kid. Janice told us not to take any of the food shown at the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had this urge to say something&amp;#8230; I don&#039;t really know if it was the Level that told me this, or if my mask said it for me&amp;#8230; But it seemed to have saved us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Champagne, dear maiden?&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clerk looked at me and pointed to its right, away from the line or visible eating area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sheeeeeee did it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hmph, sure did. Good job Kyra!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I told you I was efficient in my experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;She sounds just like me! Mask doing everything! I&#039;m so proud! Heha!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Now we have opened up a path to a lounge area. There we can stay as our main base of operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s carry on shall we?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised myself, but I guess my mask knows a lot more than I do myself. We made it to this lounge area. More Maidens wearing masks were walking around here too. Seemed like everyone was busy. The ceiling was taller then normal and had these colorful &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182&quot;&gt;birds flying around&lt;/a&gt; these bushes full of flowers hanging from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice told me that this would be my new home for now. I had my own little room waiting for me. As we walked towards it, I could see many different members doing their tasks. It looked so interesting&amp;#8230; did one of them have a tail?&amp;#8230; You know what? Never mind that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to hall that contains the entrance to my room, Janice was called by another member on the other side of the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;borderblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh ohh! Looks like someone is in trouble! Hehe&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;No, Mackie is a Pantalone user like me. We need to share info with each other to make sure everyone is in check remember?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gah! T&#039;was a joke Janice, no need to get funny on someone such as myself. Haheh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yeah, just&amp;#8230; never mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Greetings Janice, Sully and&amp;#8230; Oh look what we have here. You must be a new member! Kyra right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indeed it is. Pleasure to meet you Mackie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I assume Janice had already informed you on our mission and such. Your job will be searching for those who know too much about our operations. I can see that you and Janice will make a great duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t ironically forget about the most amusing jokester there ever was!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes, and you Sullivan, if you&#039;re not busy doing your proper job. Being a distraction, that is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh you are always so generous to me! heh&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Landon needs you for a task Sullivan. You have been called for a distraction mission. He&#039;ll inform you once you arrive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of course! In need of the self-proclaimed best amirite!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And as for you Janice, you have been called for an infiltration mission in The M.E.G. Database all the way at &lt;a href=&quot;http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to set yourself up in a few hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janice:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Right, on it! Have fun with your new home Kyra!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackie:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As for you Kyra, you&#039;ll be going with Janice when she is ready. I see you are eager to start helping so this can be your first mission. In the meantime, make yourself at home Kyra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyra:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Will do. Thank you for your kindness!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into my room as I watched Janice run to hers at the other hall, preparing for her adventure. She&#039;s been so nice to me; it&#039;s different from the careless feeling I get from most people in The Backrooms. I felt the same amongst the rest of The Masked Maidens but she felt&amp;#8230; different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I closed the door behind me, I looked around to see a bed, some books on a shelf, a couch, and a carpet. Even a few cabinets and a lamp. Felt like home to me. I guess this was furnished by the Level itself? Who knows. The room also had purple accents like the rest of the Level, but I learnt that it was one of its effects. I wondered what its true colors were. Well&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;I guess I can finally show my true colors here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May our journey together be filled with victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						 <div style="text-align: right;"></div> <h1><span><strong>May 19th, 2021:</strong></span></h1> <p>After what felt like eons of living in a prison for the innocent, I finally feel like my life is finally getting somewhere better. With the mask I feel like I am home again. Without it, I feel like I am trapped within my own mind. That I am within the flow of my own thoughts, blocked by a locked door without the key. The mask is the key; <em>I am finally free.</em></p> <p><em>Let's carry on the show, shall we?</em></p> <p><em>To someone who tried their entire life to escape the <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0">yellow halls</a>, the cold concrete floors of <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1">Level 1</a> would feel like a shallow grave of a reward. But that's what this world is, a purgatory. And from what we've learned&#8230; home isn't so different after all. Living your entire life to get nothing but a hollow prize that never truly existed. Let's see if we can find any differences together.</em></p> <p><em>We were traversing through the stone cold halls. Us, and the others. Sullivan is an interesting character. He never wants to take his mask off. It seems like he never will or possibly never even could, but how can we blame him? I wouldn't want to be taken off either. We are perfect for each other. Janice is&#8230; different from what we have seen&#8230; It almost feels like a warm welcome after everything we have been through. Such a pity that we both ended up in this situation after all.</em></p> <p><em>That's when she started to ask questions while I was away.</em></p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So&#8230; Janice right?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yes, what might it be Kyra?</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> I was just thinking about my mask&#8230; it considered us to be the same, but it feels different.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Well, why would you be any different from your true self if it is yourself?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> To be precise, a mask is somewhat sentient when you use it. It will then consider you and itself as the same being. Such as the reason why it goes by your name.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> It's just like, different&#8230; but it feels the same way as I do.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah, it's seen all your memories and it feels like it was a part of them. It feels the same pain as you do.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>It must be the reason why I feel like everything is hilariously painful!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wow&#8230; So, you two have different masks. Do they hold different effects?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yeah, even carry different personalities&#8230; but it's almost like portraying your true self. My mask is a Pantalone Mask. It can make me seem.. off sometimes, but it pretty much keeps the way I act normally. Sully's mask is&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>An entire can of worms that has already been opened by a fairly amusing jester! Heheha!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Sigh&#8230;</em> always interrupting me&#8230;</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>I mean, who would wanna keep me quiet? Heh&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Right&#8230; his mask is an Arlecchino Mask. The mask bases its entire thing off of comedy that is practically nonsense. He almost never takes it off.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>No need to turn the lights off in this wonderous showcase of amusement! Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Ooh&#8230; What would my mask be?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Your mask is a Buskin Mask, otherwise known as a Tragedy Mask, popular in Greek theaters. Your mask makes you act a bit more impatient and very dramatic. You'll probably complain quite a bit using it. No offense.</p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Nah! This is all very interesting to me!&#8230; I feel a lot better then I normally was back in Camp.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Your group is under a constant hold by The M.E.G. who are fairly corrupt in their goals. Sullivan can tell you if he'd like.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>When innocent mysteries stay unknown amongst the overlords they use the innocent for their overlooked research! It's all a hoax! A ruse to so that they can keep themselves safe. I was super lucky to be a part of that agonizing process! But that is how I met myself! On a date of destiny! Heheha!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> So you're telling me they did experiments on you with the mask and you escaped with it?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Yup! He's been through a lot for how carefree he acts.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Personality is in the jeans! Too bad I am using a different pair of pants. Hehe.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> And what's your plan here?</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> To stop the spread of that corruption. And put an end to their control. We will give the other groups the same treatment if they try to rise after the conflict ends.</p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>A silent war, which isn't silent anymore because we just talked about it! Hmm.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Wow, that's very admirable.</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Thank you Kyra. I admire your enthusiasm to help us in our quest. Now, we shall continue to reach our destination. The Madam needs to greet us.</p> </div> <hr /> <p>It's amazing, it really is. I just couldn't believe that I feel like I have a purpose in something. It's something I dreamt of every day in The Backrooms. I feel like I fit in somewhere with the rest of the puzzle. It's a very comforting feeling knowing that you matter in something for once. If this is my true purpose, then I will fulfil that mission.</p> <p>We then continued walking down the damp halls of Level 1, looking for something that was unknown to me at the time. I didn't know where I was going with them, but I knew that I'd be better off there then where I was before. We saw a few Entities in the distance, but we never confronted one; we didn't need to.</p> <p>Something about the cold of Level 1 really made me feel a lot better then in Level 0; still damp, but it wasn't warm. It was actually soothing and kind of refreshing. Usually I tried not to slip on the countless puddles of water on the floor. It's a strange thought to think that someone's fate may have been sealed by a puddle in this Level. Maybe while being chased? Most likely&#8230;</p> <p>Damn&#8230; when did I get so dark with my thoughts? Well, I guess I was always dark.</p> <p>But after a long walk, we finally found it. Glimmering in the distance was a beautiful golden mirror. The gold itself looked real and was carved with a floral design. It was expertly crafted. And as I walked closer to it, the more it seemed to glow. It was all foggy inside, its contents left to my imagination &#8212; and my curiosity. I wanted to know more.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Woah!</p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> Get your masks&#8230; <em>it's showtime.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> Right&#8230; Here we go&#8230; <em>The spotlight has shined down on me once more.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>One foot after the other! Baby steps! Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Remember Sully, we can't mess around in The Reflection. It is a fragile place.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Of course! Can't go around breaking the mirrors. I don't need more bad luck than what I already have! Haheh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>I assume we have our audience waiting on the other side?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Mhm! you're right. They'll be happy to see you Kyra. A new member is always welcomed here.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Gotta treat 'em the way you wanna be treated! I guess I just want to be in pain!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>When we walk into this mirror, we'll be transported to&#8230; well, you may know it as <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-939">Level 939</a>. A hall of mirrors that may take us to wherever we need to be.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>It sounds fairly intriguing&#8230; where must we go from there?</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Simply using the exit will lead back home. <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-294">Level 294</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Informance is your performance.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Well, indeed it is. Let's not waste anymore time and get into it.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Through the curtain.</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>When we walked in we were greeted by a large hall that looked to be in medieval origin. There were many mirrors all lined up on each side of the hall. Each mirror was labeled with a number. We came out of a mirror labeled &quot;Level 1&quot;. It seemed to be in random order, which was weird to think about.</p> <p>I was honestly amazed by that place. Just the ability to travel anywhere in a few seconds is pretty powerful. I was just wondering about how it was discovered and what possibilities this gives us. As we continued down the hall I could see a bunch of other masked members, but some of them looked&#8230; off. Hazy and foggy is the only way I could put it. That was until I walked up to one. It was me! But, like a ghost. Janice explained that this was a normal effect in Level 939 and told me not to interact with them.</p> <p>I was curious, but I stopped myself and continued on forward. Then, when we reached the Entrance to Level μ we had reached a barrier.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>MM Member-1 &quot;Bauta&quot;:</strong> <em>Hey! Stay back!</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Oooohohhohh! Spicy!</em></p> <p><strong>MM Member-2 &quot;Pantalone&quot;:</strong> <em>Sorry for my friend here, but you guys can't enter Level μ at the moment.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Ohh, why would that be?&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>MM Member-2 &quot;Pantalone&quot;:</strong> <em>Well, the area is currently being searched for an M.E.G. spy. The Madam had sent a search group inside and we can't let any of them leave just yet until they are found.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Right. There's a mouse in your home and you don't have any traps left to catch it. So you send a bunch of cats to eat it up! Heh.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>So I can see we cannot enter such place currently until this spy is caught in their act.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Seems about right. We can head somewhere else for the time being.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>On the road again my friends! Let's stop for some ice cream! Heha!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>You know, that reminded me&#8230; We can head to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67">Level 67</a>! Up for baked goods anyone?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Looks like we'll be getting somewhere after all.</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>So, we head over to the mirror that was labeled &quot;Station 2: Level 67&quot;. I thought to myself, 'baked goods?' I wondered what they meant by that until I saw for myself. It was a bakery. It looked pretty retro, which I thought was cool. The place had a purple accent to it. It was neat!&#8230; however Sully mentioned how it was colored orange so I thought it might just be an effect.</p> <p>Janice mentioned to behave at The Waiting Line. There were <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9">Facelings</a> stretching on for quite a bit&#8230; I tried to be patient, but all I had in my mind were complaints. She told me that the Facelings would turn on us if we tried to cut through. I was hesitant but I waited. Once we finally got to the counter, there was another Faceling there posing as a clerk. He pointed at all the baked goods and even showed me a cinnamon roll. Those were my favorite back when I was a kid. Janice told us not to take any of the food shown at the counter.</p> <p>But I had this urge to say something&#8230; I don't really know if it was the Level that told me this, or if my mask said it for me&#8230; But it seemed to have saved us.</p> <p><em>Champagne, dear maiden?&#8230;</em></p> <p>The clerk looked at me and pointed to its right, away from the line or visible eating area.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Sheeeeeee did it!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Hmph, sure did. Good job Kyra!</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>I told you I was efficient in my experiences.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>She sounds just like me! Mask doing everything! I'm so proud! Heha!</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Now we have opened up a path to a lounge area. There we can stay as our main base of operations.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Let's carry on shall we?</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>I was surprised myself, but I guess my mask knows a lot more than I do myself. We made it to this lounge area. More Maidens wearing masks were walking around here too. Seemed like everyone was busy. The ceiling was taller then normal and had these colorful <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182">birds flying around</a> these bushes full of flowers hanging from above.</p> <p>Janice told me that this would be my new home for now. I had my own little room waiting for me. As we walked towards it, I could see many different members doing their tasks. It looked so interesting&#8230; did one of them have a tail?&#8230; You know what? Never mind that.</p> <p>When I got to hall that contains the entrance to my room, Janice was called by another member on the other side of the hall.</p> <hr /> <div class="borderblock"> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Oh ohh! Looks like someone is in trouble! Hehe&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>No, Mackie is a Pantalone user like me. We need to share info with each other to make sure everyone is in check remember?</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Gah! T'was a joke Janice, no need to get funny on someone such as myself. Haheh&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Yeah, just&#8230; never mind.</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Greetings Janice, Sully and&#8230; Oh look what we have here. You must be a new member! Kyra right?</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Indeed it is. Pleasure to meet you Mackie.</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>I assume Janice had already informed you on our mission and such. Your job will be searching for those who know too much about our operations. I can see that you and Janice will make a great duo.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Don't ironically forget about the most amusing jokester there ever was!</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Yes, and you Sullivan, if you're not busy doing your proper job. Being a distraction, that is.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Oh you are always so generous to me! heh&#8230;</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>Landon needs you for a task Sullivan. You have been called for a distraction mission. He'll inform you once you arrive.</em></p> <p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> <em>Of course! In need of the self-proclaimed best amirite!?</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>And as for you Janice, you have been called for an infiltration mission in The M.E.G. Database all the way at <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4">Level 4</a>. You will need to set yourself up in a few hours.</em></p> <p><strong>Janice:</strong> <em>Right, on it! Have fun with your new home Kyra!</em></p> <p><strong>Mackie:</strong> <em>As for you Kyra, you'll be going with Janice when she is ready. I see you are eager to start helping so this can be your first mission. In the meantime, make yourself at home Kyra.</em></p> <p><strong>Kyra:</strong> <em>Will do. Thank you for your kindness!</em></p> </div> <hr /> <p>I walked into my room as I watched Janice run to hers at the other hall, preparing for her adventure. She's been so nice to me; it's different from the careless feeling I get from most people in The Backrooms. I felt the same amongst the rest of The Masked Maidens but she felt&#8230; different.</p> <p>As I closed the door behind me, I looked around to see a bed, some books on a shelf, a couch, and a carpet. Even a few cabinets and a lamp. Felt like home to me. I guess this was furnished by the Level itself? Who knows. The room also had purple accents like the rest of the Level, but I learnt that it was one of its effects. I wondered what its true colors were. Well&#8230; <em>I guess I can finally show my true colors here.</em></p> <p><em><strong>May our journey together be filled with victory.</strong></em></p> <hr /> <div style="text-align: right;"> <div class="collapsible-block"> <div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Author(s)</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none"> <div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">Hide&nbsp;author</a></div> <div class="collapsible-block-content"> <p>The original author of this entry is <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1763713140" alt="Stretchsterz" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz" >Stretchsterz</a></span></p> <table class="wiki-content-table"> <tr> <th colspan="2">Other Pages By This Author</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Levels</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-289">Level 289</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-287">Level 287</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5">Terror Hotel</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6-1">The Snackrooms</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-8">Cave System</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-9">The Suburbs</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11">The Infinite City</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-12">Matrix</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-36-1">The Plane</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-40">Roller Rockin' Pizza!</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-43">WaterWorld</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-53">Alone</a> | [<a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-54">Stairwell of Spirals</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-64">The Lurking Darkness</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-66">Swampy Waters</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-71">Void Basement</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-81">Zoological Office</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-92">Crimson Glow</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-94">Motion</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-386">Twisted Halls</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-924">The Nuclear Family</a> | [<a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-293">Alpha</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-286">Level 286</a> | <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-serpents-void">The Serpents Void</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-hub">The Hub</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/trimmed:joke-level-420">Level 420 (Joke)</a> | <a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/joke-level-fridge">Level Fridge (Joke)</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Rooms</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Traders-Vault">Traders Vault</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-surveillance-room">The Surveillance Room</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Entitles</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-3">Smilers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6">Dullers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-15">Wretches</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-31">Camo Crawlers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-32">The Animations</a> | <strong><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-33">THE KING</a></strong> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-48">Aiden</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-54">Scrappers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-63">The Mangled</a>] | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-75">Wranglers</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-76">What the hell is this?</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-77">The Dreamweaver</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-85">Paralies</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-167">The Party Hosts</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>Objects</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>GOIs</th> <td><a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g">The M.E.G.</a> | <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-B.N.T.G.">The B.N.T.G.</a></td> </tr> <tr> <th>POIs</th> <td>Coming Soon!</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Tales</th> <td><a class="newpage" href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/m-e-g-the-discovery-of-the-wretch">M.E.G.

Once you receive this message, write a letter of response using the extra paper attached to this letter acknowledging your initiation into the group and send it back via the Messenger.</span></span></span></p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-15929331631692055547" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">How do you do so, you ask? Why, each Messenger has a special feather located at the tip of its tail. This feather is actually a quill equipped with <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-26">Maiden's ink</a>, the secret solution that the Masked Maidens use to communicate, which can only be seen through the eyes of a mask. Do not hesitate to take it; unlike other feathers, this quill pen is not actually embedded in the bird's body and thus is completely harmless to use. Make sure to keep it secure and safe, as you will be using this pen to write correspondences to other members from this day forth.</span></span></span></p> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-1385969211800008340" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="oldpaper"> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Each member of the Masked Maidens is given their own personal Masked Messenger. These colorful birds come in all sorts of variations, and like snowflakes, the feather patterns of each bird are unique. However, what they all have in common is that they bear a striking physical resemblance to a peacock from baseline reality. If you see a brilliantly-colored bird, you can determine if it is one of our messengers or not based on the flowery crest on its head. Do not call out to it; if it carries a message meant for you, it will fly to you of its own volition. The Masked Maidens rely on secrecy, and thus it is paramount that this method of communication is not discovered by the M.E.G. or any other significant or corrupt group.</span></span></span></p> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-16293041381489052851" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="oldpaper"> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">When using Masked Messengers to communicate, it is best to write and send letters away from inhabited areas where there is a possibility that you may be seen. As long as they are within your eyesight, Messengers are invisible to all but those who wear masks. However, as soon as they leave your vision, they become visible to all, and in populated areas they may easily be spotted due to their flamboyant feathers. Masked Messengers travel easiest in indoor levels, and outdoor levels with constant clear weather. When sending a Messenger, it is best to employ common sense and to not release them into dangerous or volatile conditions. A detailed pamphlet on how to properly care for a Messenger is attached below.</span></span></span></p> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-20556625531610915936" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="oldpaper"> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:170%;"><span style="color: #000000">How to care for your Masked Messenger</span></span></span></p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-1019533327240672205" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Masked Messengers are hardy creatures that we use to communicate between other members of the group with clandestine messages. They are able to survive much harsher conditions that humans can, and thus can traverse levels that are dangerous to us with relative ease. However, this does not make them invulnerable to any mishaps, and thus it is best to treat your Messenger like a treasured pet and care for them accordingly.</span></span></span></p> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-7831447761239092809" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:&quot;200px&quot;;"><img src="http://backrooms-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/entity-182/182_2" style="width:&quot;200px&quot;;" alt="Missing alt text." class="image" /> <div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:&quot;200px&quot;; displ{$captionless}y:none;"> <p>Pink and white variation of Messenger feathers.</p> </div> </div> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">While Masked Messengers are able to make journeys during both day and night, they require sufficient rest in between. They can sleep at any time, whether it be day, night, or neither, due to their incredibly adaptive sleep cycles. However, when receiving a letter, it is always recommended to let them sleep for at least 24 hours (regardless of your current level's day/night cycle) before sending your Messenger back out with a reply. Though they are invisible to others, Messengers tend to grow anxious when in crowded places, and thus it is best that when accompanying one you find a secluded and quiet place to tend to their needs.</span></span></span></p> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-133626151211216457" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="oldpaper"> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Male and female Messengers do not exhibit many significant behavioral or physical differences, unlike many other birds, and thus it is appropriate to treat both the same way. Roughly every three to four months, Messengers enter their mating season, wherein both the feathers of both males and females light up with bioluminescence. Though it is rare for one Messenger to encounter another while flying, unwanted circumstances may occur by allowing Messengers to fly during their mating season. They are also prone to being spotted easily due to their constantly glowing feathers during this time, and so the Maidens are heavily encouraged to limit the amount of letters sent when this happens.</span></span></span></p> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Do not attempt to breed Messengers or keep more than one at any time. All Maidens are allowed one Messenger and one only. Professionally trained and able specialists in the Maidens are changed with distributing and raising Messengers, and it is imperative that you do not tamper with their work.</span></span></span></p> </div> <p><iframe src="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-182/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-2334552391837879" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe"></iframe></p> <div class="oldpaper"> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Masked Messengers are able to consume a wide variety of food, as they are omnivores. Almost anything that a human can digest is something that a Masked Messenger can safely consume. Though they prefer seeds and nuts, they are also able to break down meat and even dairy. Their diet requires much less food than a human diet, and thus they can live comfortably off of one meal every one or two days. The same applies for water &#8212; though they have exhibited the ability to consume regular water, <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1">Almond Water</a>, and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-44">Cashew Water</a> without any difficulties.</span></span></span></p> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">Masked Messengers fully mature in one year, and are theorized to not age. This may be incorrect, however, as Masked Messengers were discovered only a year ago and thus not enough time has elapsed for us to be able to judge their lifespans. The lack of a distinction between one Messenger and another that may signify age leads us to believe that their bodies do not break down over time. Regardless, it is important that new members keep their Messengers safe and treat them respectfully as one would any pet, because they will not be replaced in the event that one is lost.</span></span></span></p> <p><span class="Holmes"><span style="font-size:70%;"><span style="color: #000000">We look forward to hearing from you soon.
